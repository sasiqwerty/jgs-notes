				<span class="dropcaps">I</span>n the week before their departure to
				Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly
				unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy,
				Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-147">
				It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone
				that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations
				bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the
				weather.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-148">
				The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by
				Paul’s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay
				in his bed.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-149">
				By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and

				>hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape
				at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a
				witch shadow&mdash;hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded ’round darkness
				of features, eyes like glittering jewels.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-151">
				“Is he not small for his age, Jessica?” the old woman asked. Her voice
				wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-152">
				Paul’s mother answered in her soft contralto: “The Atreides are known to
				start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-153">
				“So I’ve heard, so I’ve heard,” wheezed the old woman. “Yet he’s already
				fifteen.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-154">“Yes, Your Reverence.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-155">
				“He’s awake and listening to us,” said the old woman. “Sly little
				rascal.” She chuckled. “But royalty has need of slyness. And if he’s
				really the Kwisatz Haderach…well….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-156">
				Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits.
				Two bird-bright ovals&mdash;the eyes of the old woman&mdash;seemed to
				expand and glow as they stared into his.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-157">
				“Sleep well, you sly little rascal,” said the old woman. “Tomorrow
				you’ll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-158">
				And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid
				thump.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-159">
				Paul lay awake wondering: <i class="calibre2">What’s a gom jabbar?</i>
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-167">
				Thufir Hawat, his father’s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their
				mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years,
				holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine
				the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be
				replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete&mdash;an apparent
				victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance
				contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the
				Great Houses of the Landsraad.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-168">

				Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all
				around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there
				and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound&mdash;the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-172">The dream faded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-173">
				Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his
				bed&mdash;thinking…thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play
				or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell.
				Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was
				not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at
				the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o’-the-sand
				people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate.

				Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body
				lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the
				responses: he fell into the floating awareness…focusing the
				consciousness…aortal dilation…avoiding the unfocused mechanism of
				consciousness…to be conscious by choice…blood enriched and
				swift-flooding the overload regions…<i class="calibre2"
					>one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone</i
				>…animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into
				the idea that its victims may become extinct…the animal destroys and
				does not produce…animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and
				avoid the perceptual…the human requires a background grid through which
				to see his universe…focused consciousness by choice, this forms your
				grid…bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-177">
				Over and over and over within Paul’s floating awareness the lesson
				rolled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-178">
				When dawn touched Paul’s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it
				through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and
				hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom
				ceiling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-179">
				The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze
				held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green
				eyes staring solemnly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-180">
				“You’re awake,” she said. “Did you sleep well?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-181">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-182">
				He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders
				as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have
				missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit
				Way&mdash;in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a
				semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above
				the breast pocket.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-183">
				“Hurry and dress,” she said. “Reverend Mother is waiting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-184">
				“I dreamed of her once,” Paul said. “Who is she?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-185">
				“She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she’s the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-186">
				“I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?”
			</p>

				“We did not <i class="calibre2">get</i> Arrakis.” Jessica flicked dust

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-190">
				Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible
				hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-191">
				Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across
				the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. “You’ll learn about…the gom
				jabbar soon enough,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-192">
				He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-193">
				Jessica spoke without turning. “Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning

				<span class="dropcaps">T</span>he Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat
				in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach. Windows on each
				side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the
				green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother
				ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a
				little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and association with that
				abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission
				that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight.
				Even the Padishah Emperor’s Truthsayer couldn’t evade that

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-197">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-199">
				The nuances of Paul’s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She
				said: “He’s a cautious one, Jessica.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-200">
				Jessica’s hand went to Paul’s shoulder, tightened there. For a
				heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under
				control. “Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-201">
				<i class="calibre2">What does she fear?</i> Paul wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-202">
				The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like
				Jessica’s, but strong bones…hair: the Duke’s black-black but with
				browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin,
				disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old
				Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-203">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura&mdash;even

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-204">
				“Teaching is one thing,” she said, “the basic ingredient is another. We

				enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-205">
				Jessica took her hand from Paul’s shoulder. “Your Reverence, I&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-206">
				“Jessica, you know it must be done.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-207">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-208">
				Jessica straightened. “Yes…of course.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-209">
				Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother’s

				apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-212">“Test?” He looked up at her.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-213">
				“Remember that you’re a duke’s son,” Jessica said. She whirled and
				strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly
				behind her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-214">
				Paul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. “Does one dismiss the
				Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-215">
				A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. “The Lady Jessica
				<i class="calibre2">was</i> my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at
				school.” She nodded. “And a good one, too. Now,
				<i class="calibre2">you</i> come here!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-216">
				The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he
				could think about it. <i class="calibre2">Using the Voice on me</i>, he
				thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-217">
				“See this?” she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green
				metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul
				saw that one side was open&mdash;black and oddly frightening. No light
				penetrated that open blackness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-218">
				“Put your right hand in the box,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-219">
				Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said:
				“Is this how you obey your mother?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-220">
				He looked up into bird-bright eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-221">
				Slowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his
				hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed
				around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as
				though his hand were asleep.
			</p>

				>A predatory look filled the old woman’s features. She lifted her right

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-224">“Stop!” she snapped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-225">
				<i class="calibre2">Using the Voice again!</i> He swung his attention
				back to her face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-226">
				“I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,” she said. “The gom jabbar, the
				high-handed enemy. It’s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip.
				Ah-ah! Don’t pull away or you’ll feel that poison.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-227">
				Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention
				from the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around
				silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-228">
				“A duke’s son <i class="calibre2">must</i> know about poisons,” she
				said. “It’s the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your
				drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow
				ones and the ones in between. Here’s a new one for you: the gom jabbar.
				It kills only animals.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-229">
				Pride overcame Paul’s fear. “You dare suggest a duke’s son is an
				animal?” he demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-230">
				“Let us say I suggest you may be human,” she said. “Steady! I warn you

				into your neck before you escape me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-231">
				“Who are you?” he whispered. “How did you trick my mother into leaving

				away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-234">
				“Good,” she said. “You pass the first test. Now, here’s the way of the
				rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the
				only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-235">
				Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling. “If I call out there’ll

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-236">
				“Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door.

				honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-237">
				Curiosity reduced Paul’s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in
				the old woman’s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out
				there…if this were truly a test…. And whatever it was, he knew himself
				caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He
				recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had
				taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.

				“Old woman!” she snapped. “You’ve courage, and that can’t be denied.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-244">
				He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly

				The tingling became an itch.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-245">
				The old woman said: “You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape
				a trap? There’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the

				remove a threat to his kind.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-246">
				The itch became the faintest burning. “Why are you doing this?” he

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-247">
				“To determine if you’re human. Be silent.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-248">
				Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation

				move them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-249">“It burns,” he whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-250">“Silence!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-251">
				Pain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-262">
				He fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his
				hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited
				every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from
				that box.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-263">“Do it!” she snapped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-264">
				He jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No
				sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the
				fingers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-265">
				“Pain by nerve induction,” she said. “Can’t go around maiming potential
				humans. There’re those who’d give a
				<span

				>pretty for the secret of this box, though.” She slipped it into the
				folds of her gown.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-267">“But the pain&mdash;” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-268">
				“Pain,” she sniffed. “A human can override any nerve in the body.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-269">
				Paul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at
				four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the
				hand to his side, looked at the old woman. “You did that to my mother
				once?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-270">
				“Ever sift sand through a screen?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-271">
				The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher
				awareness: <i class="calibre2">Sand through a screen.</i> He nodded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-272">
				“We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-273">
				He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. “And that’s
				all there is to it&mdash;pain?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-274">
				“I observed you in pain, lad. Pain’s merely the axis of the test. Your
				mother’s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her
				teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-275">
				He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: “It’s truth!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-276">
				She stared at him.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one?</i
				>
				She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself:
				<i class="calibre2">“Hope clouds observation.”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-277">
				“You know when people believe what they say,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-278">“I know it.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-279">
				The harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test

				Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-281">“I prefer to stand.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-282">
				“Your mother sat at my feet once.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-283">“I’m not my mother.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-284">
				“You hate us a little, eh?” She looked toward the door, called out:
				“Jessica!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-285">
				The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the
				room. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint
				smile.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-286">
				“Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?” the old woman asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-287">
				“I both love and hate you,” Jessica said. “The hate&mdash;that’s from
				pains I must never forget. The love&mdash;that’s….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-288">
				“Just the basic fact,” the old woman said, but her voice was gentle.
				“You may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it
				that no one interrupts us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-289">
				Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back
				to it. <i class="calibre2">My son lives</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>My son lives and is…human. I knew he was…but…he lives. Now, I can go

				was immediate and pressing against her senses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-290">
				<i class="calibre2">My son lives.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-291">
				Paul looked at his mother.
				<i class="calibre2">She told the truth.</i> He wanted to get away alone
				and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he
				was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him.
				<span

					title="17"></span
				><i class="calibre2">They spoke truth.</i> His mother had undergone this
				test. There must be terrible purpose in it…the pain and fear had been
				terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds.
				They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with
				terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-293">
				“Someday, lad,” the old woman said, “you, too, may have to stand outside
				a door like that. It takes a measure of doing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-294">
				Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the
				Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then
				from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in
				brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he
				might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his
				flesh-world into something greater.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-295">
				“Why do you test for humans?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-296">“To set you free.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-297">“Free?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-298">
				“Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this
				would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to
				enslave them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-299">
				“‘Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind,’” Paul
				quoted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-300">
				“Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,” she
				said. “But what the O.C. Bible should’ve said is: ‘Thou shalt not make a
				machine to counterfeit a <i class="calibre2">human</i> mind.’ Have you
				studied the Mentat in your service?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-301">
				“I’ve studied <i class="calibre2">with</i> Thufir Hawat.”
			</p>

				>“The Great Revolt took away a crutch,” she said. “It forced
				<i class="calibre2">human</i> minds to develop. Schools were started to
				train <i class="calibre2">human</i> talents.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-304">“Bene Gesserit schools?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-305">
				She nodded. “We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the
				Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes
				almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-306">“Politics,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-307">
				“Kull wahad!” the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-308">
				“I’ve not told him, Your Reverence,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-309">
				The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. “You did that on
				remarkably few clues,” she said. “Politics indeed. The original Bene
				Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of
				continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity
				without separating human stock from animal stock&mdash;for breeding
				purposes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-310">
				The old woman’s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He
				felt an offense against what his mother called his
				<i class="calibre2">instinct for rightness</i>. It wasn’t that Reverend
				Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was
				something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-311">
				He said: “But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don’t
				know their ancestry.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-312">
				“The genetic lines are always in our records,” she said. “Your mother
				knows that either she’s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was
				acceptable in itself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-313">
				“Then why couldn’t she know who her parents are?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-314">
				<span

				to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have
				many reasons.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-316">
				Again, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: “You take a lot
				on yourselves.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-317">
				The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering:
				<i class="calibre2">Did I hear criticism in his voice?</i> “We carry a
				heavy burden,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-318">
				Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He
				leveled a measuring stare at her, said: “You say maybe I’m the…Kwisatz
				Haderach. What’s that, a human gom jabbar?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-319">
				“Paul,” Jessica said. “You mustn’t take that tone with&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-320">
				“I’ll handle this, Jessica,” the old woman said. “Now, lad, do you know
				about the Truthsayer drug?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-321">
				“You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,” he said. “My
				mother’s told me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-322">
				“Have you ever seen truthtrance?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-323">He shook his head. “No.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-324">
				“The drug’s dangerous,” she said, “but it gives insight. When a
				Truthsayer’s gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her
				memory&mdash;in her body’s memory. We look down so many avenues of the
				past…but only feminine avenues.” Her voice took on a note of sadness.
				“Yet, there’s a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by
				it, terrorized. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift
				of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot&mdash;into both
				feminine and masculine pasts.”

				<span class="dropcaps">I</span>t was a relief globe of a world, partly
				in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with
				rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless
				room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls,
				filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls
				hanging in mobile suspensor fields.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-335">
				An ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at
				the center of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them
				occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round
				of face and with sullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with
				effeminate face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-336">
				Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in
				shadows spinning it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-337">
				A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the
				chuckle: “There it is, Piter&mdash;the biggest
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-338"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="22"></span
				>mantrap in all history. And the Duke’s headed into its jaws. Is it not
				a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-339">
				“Assuredly, Baron,” said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet,
				musical quality.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-340">
				The fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all
				eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it
				was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors
				of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it.
				Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire.
				The polar caps were insets of finest cloudmilk diamonds.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-341">
				The fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. “I invite you to
				observe,” the basso voice rumbled. “Observe closely, Piter, and you,
				too, Feyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy
				degrees south&mdash;these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not
				remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or
				rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps&mdash;so small. Could anyone
				mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique
				victory.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-342">
				A smile touched Piter’s lips. “And to think, Baron: the Padishah Emperor
				believes he’s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-343">
				“That’s a nonsensical statement,” the Baron rumbled. “You say this to
				confuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my
				nephew.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-344">
				The sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the
				black leotards he wore. He sat upright as
				<span

				>a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-346">
				Piter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide
				enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the
				cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-347">“Well?” the Baron demanded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-348">“The fool answered us, Baron!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-349">
				“Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?” the
				Baron asked. “Well, what does he say?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-350">
				“He’s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as ‘Harkonnen’&mdash;no ‘Sire
				et Cher Cousin,’ no title, nothing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-351">
				“It’s a good name,” the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his
				impatience. “What does dear Leto say?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-352">
				“He says: ‘Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your
				treachery and this all men know.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-353">“And?” the Baron asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-354">
				“He says: ‘The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.’ He signs
				it: ‘Duke Leto of Arrakis.’” Piter began to laugh. “Of Arrakis! Oh, my!
				This is almost too rich!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-355">
				“Be silent, Piter,” the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though
				shut off with a switch. “Kanly, is it?” the Baron asked. “Vendetta, heh?
				And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he
				means it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-356">
				“You made the peace gesture,” Piter said. “The forms have been obeyed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-357">
				“For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,” the Baron said. And he
				thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I must do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his
					usefulness</i
				>. The Baron stared
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-358"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="24"></span
				>across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeing the feature about him
				that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue
				within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-359">
				A grin flashed across Piter’s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath
				those eyes like holes. “But, Baron! Never has revenge been more
				beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to
				<i class="calibre2">make</i> Leto exchange Caladan for Dune&mdash;and
				without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-360">
				In a cold voice, the Baron said: “You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-361">
				“But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you…you are touched by jealousy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-362">“Piter!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-363">
				“Ah-ah, Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this
				delicious scheme by yourself?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-364">
				“Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-365">
				“Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-366">
				“Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-367">
				“Truth without fear surprises the Baron,” Piter said. His face drew down
				into a caricature of a frowning mask. “Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I
				know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back
				just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I’m
				yet of much use. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune
				planet&mdash;waste not. True, Baron?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-368">
				The Baron continued to stare at Piter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-369">
				Feyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-371">
				“Feyd,” the Baron said. “I told you to listen and learn when I invited
				you in here. Are you learning?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-372">
				“Yes, Uncle.” The voice was carefully subservient.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-373">
				“Sometimes I wonder about Piter,” the Baron said. “I cause pain out of
				necessity, but he…I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself,
				I can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against
				him soon, and that’ll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto
				will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor…and knowing that will be
				a terrible thing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-374">
				“Then why haven’t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his
				ribs quietly and efficiently?” Piter asked. “You talk of pity,
				but&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-375">
				“The Duke <i class="calibre2">must</i> know when I encompass his doom,”
				the Baron said. “And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The
				knowledge will give them pause. I’ll gain a bit more room to maneuver.
				The necessity is obvious, but I don’t have to like it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-376">
				“Room to maneuver,” Piter sneered. “Already you have the Emperor’s eyes
				on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a
				legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be
				an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-377">
				“You’d like to see that, wouldn’t you, Piter?” the Baron asked. “You’d
				enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack
				this castle. You’d truly enjoy that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-378">
				“Does the Baron need to ask?” Piter whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-379">
				“You should’ve been a Bashar of the Corps,” the Baron
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-381">
				Piter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly
				behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and
				the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-382">
				“Do not toy with Piter, Baron,” Piter said. “You promised me the Lady

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-383">
				“For what, Piter?” the Baron asked. “For pain?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-384">
				Piter stared at him, dragging out the silence.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-385">
				Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: “Uncle, do I

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-387">
				“The trap will bring him to you, Baron,” Piter muttered.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-388">
				“That’s not my question,” the Baron said. “You’ll recall that you

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-389">
				“I’m not often wrong, Baron,” Piter said, and for the first time there

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-393">“But, Uncle&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-394">
				“A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-396">
				“Ah! Indeed <i class="calibre2">but</i>! But he consumes too much spice,

				<i class="calibre2">but</i> he still can err.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-397">
				Piter spoke in a low, sullen tone: “Did you call me in here to impair my

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-398">
				“Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-399">
				“Are you already training my replacement?” Piter demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-400">
				“Replace <i class="calibre2">you</i>? Why, Piter, where could I find

				“Then I’m on display,” Piter said. “Shall I dance? Shall I perform my
				various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-407">
				“Precisely,” the Baron said. “You are on display. Now, be silent.” He
				glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew’s lips, the full and pouting
				look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in
				amusement. “This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned
				to perform certain duties. The fact that it’s encased in a human body,
				however, must not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes
				think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-408">
				“They were toys compared to me,” Piter snarled. “You yourself, Baron,
				could outperform those <i class="calibre2">machines</i>.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-409">
				“Perhaps,” the Baron said. “Ah, well….” He took a deep breath, belched.
				“Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-411">
				“I’ll be the judge of this,” the Baron said. “I give you an order,
				Mentat. Perform one of your various functions.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-412">
				“So be it,” Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of
				dignity&mdash;as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his
				entire body. “In a few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke
				Leto will embark on a Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will
				<span

				that Arrakeen is easier to defend.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-414">
				“Listen carefully, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Observe the plans within
				plans within plans.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-415">
				Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-416">
				“There are several tangential possibilities,” Piter said. “I indicate
				that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the
				possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a
				place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have
				become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing
				beyond the Imperium.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-417">
				“The Duke’s too proud a man for that,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-418">
				“It is a possibility,” Piter said. “The ultimate effect for us would be
				the same, however.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-419">
				“No, it would not!” the Baron growled. “I must have him dead and his
				line ended.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-420">
				“That’s the high probability,” Piter said. “There are certain
				preparations that indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke
				appears to be doing none of these things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-421">
				“So,” the Baron sighed. “Get on with it, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-422">
				“At Arrakeen,” Piter said, “the Duke and his family will occupy the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-426">
				“Your uncle makes a joke,” Piter said. “He calls Count Fenring
				Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor’s interest in
				smuggling operations on Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-427">
				Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. “Why?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-428">
				“Don’t be dense, Feyd,” the Baron snapped. “As long as the Guild remains
				effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How
				else could spies and assassins move about?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-429">
				Feyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless “Oh-h-h-h.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-430">
				“We’ve arranged diversions at the Residency,” Piter said. “There’ll be
				an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir&mdash;an attempt which could
				succeed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-431">
				“Piter,” the Baron rumbled, “you indicated&mdash;”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-433">
				“Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,” the Baron said. “Of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-434">
				“Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,” Piter
				said. “The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But
				Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School
				graduate with Imperial Conditioning&mdash;supposedly safe enough to
				minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial
				Conditioning. It’s assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed
				without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, given

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-437">
				“Another time,” the Baron said. “Continue, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-438">
				“In place of Yueh,” Piter said, “we’ll drag a most interesting suspect
				across Hawat’s path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend
				her to Hawat’s attention.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-439">“Her?” Feyd-Rautha asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-440">
				“The Lady Jessica herself,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-441">
				“Is it not sublime?” Piter asked. “Hawat’s mind will be so filled with
				this prospect it’ll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to
				kill her.” Piter frowned, then: “But I don’t think he’ll be able to
				carry it off.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-442">
				“You don’t want him to, eh?” the Baron asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-443">
				“Don’t distract me,” Piter said. “While Hawat’s occupied with the Lady
				Jessica, we’ll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns
				and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he’s gaining
				a measure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we’ll signal Yueh
				and move in with our major force…ah….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-444">
				“Go ahead, tell him all of it,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-445">
				“We’ll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in
				Harkonnen livery.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-446">
				“Sardaukar!” Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread
				Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier-fanatics of the
				Padishah Emperor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-447">
				“You see how I trust you, Feyd,” the Baron said. “No hint of this must
				ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against
				the Imperial House and there’d be chaos.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-448">
				“The main point,” Piter said, “is this: since House Harkonnen
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-449"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="32"></span
				>is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we’ve gained a true
				advantage. It’s a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used
				cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any
				other House in the Imperium.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-450">
				“You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,” the Baron said.
				“Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we’ll have an irrevocable
				directorship in the CHOAM Company.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-451">
				Feyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth,
				each noble House dipping from the company’s coffers whatever it could
				under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM
				directorships&mdash;they were the real evidence of political power in
				the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the
				Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and
				<i class="calibre2">his</i> supporters.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-452">
				“The Duke Leto,” Piter said, “may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum
				along the desert’s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that
				imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty’s
				agents&mdash;the planetary ecologist. You may remember him&mdash;Kynes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-453">
				“Feyd remembers him,” the Baron said. “Get on with it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-454">
				“You do not drool very prettily, Baron,” Piter said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-455">
				“Get on with it, I command you!” the Baron roared.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-456">
				Piter shrugged. “If matters go as planned,” he said, “House Harkonnen
				will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will
				have dispensation of that fief. His own
				<i class="calibre2">personal</i> agent will rule on Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-457">
				“More profits,” Feyd-Rautha said.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-460">
				“And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the
				Atreides,” Piter said. “They will know.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-461">
				“They will know,” the Baron breathed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-462">
				“Loveliest of all,” Piter said, “is that the Duke will know, too. He
				knows now. He can already feel the trap.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-463">
				“It’s true the Duke knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note of
				sadness. “He could not help but know…more’s the pity.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-464">
				The Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged
				from the shadows, his figure took on dimension&mdash;grossly and
				immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to
				reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors
				harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in
				actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-465">
				“I am hungry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with
				a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes.
				“Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-484">
				“You thought only of your Duke’s desire for a son,” the old woman

				“I’ll shield him as well as I’m able.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-506">
				“Shield!” the old woman snapped. “You well know the weakness there!

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-507">
				Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness.
				“Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-508">
				“Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-511">
				The old woman’s voice softened. “Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in
				your place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own
				path.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-512">“I know.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-513">
				“You’re as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-514">“I understand…the necessity.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-515">
				“What you did, Jessica, and why you did it&mdash;we both know. But
				kindness forces me to tell you there’s little chance your lad will be
				the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn’t let yourself hope too much.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-516">
				Jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry
				gesture. “You make me feel like a little girl again&mdash;reciting my
				first lesson.” She forced the words out: “‘Humans must never submit to
				animals.’” A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: “I’ve been so
				lonely.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-517">
				“It should be one of the tests,” the old woman said. “Humans are almost
				always lonely. Now summon the boy. He’s had a long, frightening day. But
				he’s had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions
				about these dreams of his.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-518">
				Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it.
				“Paul, come in now, please.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-519">
				Paul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though
				she were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the
				Reverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an
				equal. He heard his mother close the door behind him.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-522">“What do you want?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-523">“Do you dream every night?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-524">
				“Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-525">
				“How do you know the difference?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-526">“I just know it.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-527">
				The old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. “What did you dream last
				night? Was it worth remembering?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-528">
				“Yes.” Paul closed his eyes. “I dreamed a cavern…and water…and a girl
				there&mdash;very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites
				in them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend
				Mother on Caladan.” Paul opened his eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-529">
				“And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen
				today?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-530">
				Paul thought about this, then: “Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-531">
				“Stamp of strangeness,” the old woman breathed, and again she shot a
				glance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. “Tell me truly now,
				Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly
				as you dreamed them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-532">
				“Yes. And I’ve dreamed about that girl before.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-533">“Oh? You know her?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-534">“I will know her.”</p>

				>Again, Paul closed his eyes. “We’re in a little place in some rocks
				where it’s sheltered. It’s almost night, but it’s hot and I can see
				patches of sand out of an opening in the rocks. We’re…waiting for
				something…for me to go meet some people. And she’s frightened but trying
				to hide it from me, and I’m excited. And she says: ‘Tell me about the
				waters of your homeworld, Usul.’” Paul opened his eyes. “Isn’t that
				strange? My homeworld’s Caladan. I’ve never even heard of a planet
				called Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-538">
				“Is there more to this dream?” Jessica prompted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-539">
				“Yes. But maybe she was calling <i class="calibre2">me</i> Usul,” Paul
				said. “I just thought of that.” Again, he closed his eyes. “She asks me
				to tell her about the waters. And I take her hand. And I say I’ll tell
				her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I have to explain some of the
				words&mdash;like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-540">
				“What poem?” the Reverend Mother asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-541">
				Paul opened his eyes. “It’s just one of Gurney Halleck’s tone poems for
				sad times.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-542">
				Behind Paul, Jessica began to recite:

				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-560">“That’s the one,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-561">
				The old woman stared at Paul, then: “Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene
				Gesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one
				of us. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the
				eyes of a mother. Possibility I see, too, but no more.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-562">
				She fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her
				out.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-563">
				Presently, she said: “As you will, then. You’ve depths in you; that I’ll
				grant.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-564">“May I go now?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-565">
				“Don’t you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the
				Kwisatz Haderach?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-566">
				“She said those who tried for it died.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-567">
				“But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed,” the Reverend
				Mother said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-568">
				<i class="calibre2">She talks of hints</i>, Paul thought.
				<i class="calibre2">She doesn’t really know anything.</i> And he said:
				“Hint then.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-569">
				“And be damned to me?” She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the
				old face. “Very well: ‘That which submits rules.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-570">
				He felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as
				tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing
				at all?
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-571">
				<span

				>“That’s a hint?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-573">
				“We’re not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,” the old
				woman said. “The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day
				it is many willows&mdash;a wall against the wind. This is the willow’s
				purpose.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-574">
				Paul stared at her. She said <i class="calibre2">purpose</i> and he felt
				the word buffet him, reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He
				experienced a sudden anger at her: fatuous old witch with her mouth full
				of platitudes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-575">
				“You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach,” he said. “You talk about
				me, but you haven’t said one thing about what we can do to help my
				father. I’ve heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my
				father were dead. Well, he isn’t!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-576">
				“If there were a thing to be done for him, we’d have done it,” the old
				woman growled. “We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible.
				But for your father, nothing. When you’ve learned to accept that as a
				fact, you’ve learned a <i class="calibre2">real</i> Bene Gesserit
				lesson.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-577">
				Paul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How
				could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His
				mind seethed with resentment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-578">
				The Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. “You’ve been training him in the
				Way&mdash;I’ve seen the signs of it. I’d have done the same in your
				shoes and devil take the Rules.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-579">Jessica nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-580">
				“Now, I caution you,” said the old woman, “to ignore the regular order

				>know how much more he needs…and that desperately.” She stepped close to
				Paul, stared down at him. “Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it. But
				if you don’t&mdash;well, we shall yet succeed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-582">
				Once more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed
				between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing,
				with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already
				were shut from her thoughts.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-583">
				But Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother’s face as she
				turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were
				more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them
				this day.

				A cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-595">
				Paul straightened, spoke without turning: “I know. I’m sitting with my

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-596">
				Hawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-597">
				Paul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-598">
				“I heard you coming down the hall,” Paul said. “And I heard you open the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-600">“I’d know the difference.”</p>

				<i class="calibre2">He might at that</i>, Hawat thought.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-602">
				Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He
				did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an
				odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already
				gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror
				with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched
				and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-607">“Does that make you sad?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-608">
				“Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-609">
				“Did my father send you up to test me?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-610">
				Hawat scowled&mdash;the boy had such observing ways about him. He

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-614">
				“That’s too cautious a word: <i class="calibre2">bad</i>. Those storms

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-621">
				Paul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering

				Paul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-624">
				“You’ll learn a great concern for water,” Hawat said. “As the Duke’s son
				you’ll never want for it, but you’ll see the pressures of thirst all
				around you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-625">
				Paul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago

				about water starvation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-626">
				“You’ll learn about the funeral plains,” she’d said, “about the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-629">
				“When you live upon Arrakis,” she had said, “khala, the land is empty.

				Paul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post

				you see no hope, Your Reverence?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-631">
				“Not for the father.” And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence,
				looked down at Paul. “Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is

				A week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words

				>“She….” Paul hesitated, found that he couldn’t tell Hawat about the
				ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-638">“Yes? What did she?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-639">
				Paul took two deep breaths. “She said a thing.” He closed his eyes,
				calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on
				some of the old woman’s tone: “‘You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings,
				son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It’s something none of your
				ancestors learned.’” Paul opened his eyes, said: “That made me angry and
				I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, ‘He’s losing it.’
				And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said, ‘He’ll
				lose that one, too.’ And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she
				said he’d already been warned&mdash;by you, by Mother, by many people.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-640">“True enough,” Hawat muttered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-641">
				“Then why’re we going?” Paul demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-642">
				“Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there’s hope in spite of
				what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain
				of wisdom?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-643">
				Paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the
				table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax.
				<i class="calibre2">She put some kind of hold on me</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2">How?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-644">
				“She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,” Paul said. “And I said
				that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-645">
				<i class="calibre2">She hit a mark there right enough</i>, Hawat
				thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-646">
				“She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he
				must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-647">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-648"

				>“How’d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?”
				Hawat asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-649">
				Paul shrugged. “Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world’s
				language, that it’s different for every world. And I thought she meant
				they didn’t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn’t it at all.
				She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the
				language you don’t hear just with your ears. And I said that’s what Dr.
				Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-650">
				Hawat chuckled. “How’d that sit with her?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-651">
				“I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to
				solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat
				at her: ‘A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding
				must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.’
				That seemed to satisfy her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-652">
				<i class="calibre2">He seems to be getting over it</i>, Hawat thought,
				<i class="calibre2"
					>but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-653">
				“Thufir,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as bad as she said?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-654">
				“Nothing could be that bad,” Hawat said and forced a smile. “Take those
				Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By
				first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there’re many, many more of
				them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many
				people, and….” Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. “…they hate
				Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this,
				lad. I tell you only as your father’s helper.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-655">
				“My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,” Paul said. “Do you know,
				Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis…perhaps not quite as bad, but much
				like it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-656">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-657"

				>“We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,” Hawat said. “Only
				what it was like long ago…mostly. But what is known&mdash;you’re right
				on that score.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-658">“Will the Fremen help us?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-659">
				“It’s a possibility.” Hawat stood up. “I leave today for Arrakis.
				Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who’s fond of you,
				heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It’s
				not that I think there’s any danger in the castle; it’s just a habit I
				want you to form.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-660">
				Paul got to his feet, moved around the table. “You’re going today?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-661">
				“Today it is, and you’ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it’ll
				be on the soil of your new world.” He gripped Paul’s right arm at the
				bicep. “Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.”
				He released the arm, patted Paul’s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly
				to the door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-662">“Thufir!” Paul called.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-663">
				Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-664">
				“Don’t sit with your back to any doors,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-665">
				A grin spread across the seamed old face. “That I won’t, lad. Depend on
				it.” And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-666">
				Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers.
				<i class="calibre2">One more day here</i>, he thought. He looked around
				the room. <i class="calibre2">We’re leaving.</i> The idea of departure
				was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled
				another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many
				things&mdash;the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the
				tides, the suns&mdash;the
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-667"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="52"></span
				>unknown sum called <i class="calibre2">nature</i>, a vague summation
				without any sense of the <i class="calibre2">now</i>. And he wondered:
				<i class="calibre2">What is the now?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-668">
				The door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched
				through it preceded by a handful of weapons.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-669">
				“Well, Gurney Halleck,” Paul called, “are you the new weapons master?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-670">
				Halleck kicked the door shut with one heel. “You’d rather I came to play
				games, I know,” he said. He glanced around the room, noting that Hawat’s
				men already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke’s
				heir. The subtle code signs were all around.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-671">
				Paul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer
				toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string
				baliset slung over Gurney’s shoulder with the multipick woven through
				the strings near the head of the fingerboard.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-672">
				Halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them
				up&mdash;the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet
				stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed
				as he turned, casting a smile across the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-673">
				“So you don’t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,” Halleck
				said. “And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall
				like a man running to his enemy’s funeral.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-674">
				Paul grinned. Of all his father’s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best,
				knew the man’s moods and deviltry, his <i class="calibre2">humors</i>,
				and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-675">
				<span

				>Halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. “If y’
				won’t talk, y’ won’t,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-677">
				Paul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: “Well, Gurney, do we
				come prepared for music when it’s fighting time?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-678">
				“So it’s sass for our elders today,” Halleck said. He tried a chord on
				the instrument, nodded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-679">
				“Where’s Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked. “Isn’t he supposed to be teaching me
				weaponry?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-680">
				“Duncan’s gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,” Halleck said. “All
				you have left is poor Gurney who’s fresh out of fight and spoiling for
				music.” He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. “And it was
				decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we’d best teach
				you the music trade so’s you won’t waste your life entire.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-681">
				“Maybe you’d better sing me a lay then,” Paul said. “I want to be sure
				how <i class="calibre2">not</i> to do it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-682">
				“Ah-h-h, hah!” Gurney laughed, and he swung into “Galacian Girls,” his
				multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:
			</p>
			<div class="block1" id="calibre_link-683">
				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-684">
					“Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls
				</p>
				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-685">Will do it for pearls,</p>
				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-686">
					And the Arrakeen for water!
				</p>
				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-687">But if you desire dames</p>

				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-690">
				“Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,” Paul said, “but if my
				mother heard you singing a bawdy like
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-691"

					title="54"></span
				>that in the castle, she’d have your ears on the outer wall for
				decoration.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-692">
				Gurney pulled at his left ear. “Poor decoration, too, they having been
				bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced
				some strange ditties on his baliset.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-693">
				“So you’ve forgotten what it’s like to find sand in your bed,” Paul
				said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his
				waist. “Then, let’s fight!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-694">
				Halleck’s eyes went wide in mock surprise. “So! It was your wicked hand
				did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master&mdash;guard yourself.”
				He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. “I’m a hellfiend out for
				revenge!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-695">
				Paul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the
				<i class="calibre2">aguile</i>, one foot forward. He let his manner go
				solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-696">
				“What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,” Paul intoned. “This
				doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man
				armed and shielded.” Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt
				the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and
				down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic
				shield-filtered flatness. “In shield fighting, one moves fast on
				defense, slow on attack,” Paul said. “Attack has the sole purpose of
				tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack
				sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!” Paul
				snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow
				thrust timed to enter a shield’s mindless defenses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-697">
				Halleck watched the action, turned at the last minute
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-698"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="55"></span
				>to let the blunted blade pass his chest. “Speed, excellent,” he said.
				“But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-699">Paul stepped back, chagrined.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-700">
				“I should whap your backside for such carelessness,” Halleck said. He
				lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. “This in the hand
				of an enemy can let out your life’s blood! You’re an apt pupil, none
				better, but I’ve warned you that not even in play do you let a man
				inside your guard with death in his hand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-701">
				“I guess I’m not in the mood for it today,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-702">
				“Mood?” Halleck’s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield’s
				filtering. “What has <i class="calibre2">mood</i> to do with it? You
				fight when the necessity arises&mdash;no matter the mood! Mood’s a thing
				for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It’s not for
				fighting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-703">“I’m sorry, Gurney.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-704">“You’re not sorry enough!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-705">
				Halleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in
				left hand, the rapier poised high in his right. “Now I say guard
				yourself for true!” He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a
				furious attack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-706">
				Paul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges
				touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the
				contact along his skin.
				<i class="calibre2">What’s gotten into Gurney?</i> he asked himself.
				<i class="calibre2">He’s not faking this!</i> Paul moved his left hand,
				dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-707">
				“You see a need for an extra blade, eh?” Halleck grunted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-708">
				<i class="calibre2">Is this betrayal?</i> Paul wondered.
				<i class="calibre2">Surely not Gurney!</i>
			</p>

				<span

					id="calibre_link-710"

				>Around the room they fought&mdash;thrust and parry, feint and
				counter-feint. The air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the
				demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not
				replenish. With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew
				stronger.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-711">
				Paul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the
				exercise table.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>If I can turn him beside the table, I’ll show him a trick</i
				>, Paul thought. <i class="calibre2">One more step, Gurney.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-712">Halleck took the step.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-713">
				Paul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck’s rapier catch
				against the table’s edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with
				rapier and came in across Halleck’s neckline with the bodkin. He stopped
				the blade an inch from the jugular.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-714">
				“Is this what you seek?” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-715">
				“Look down, lad,” Gurney panted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-716">
				Paul obeyed, saw Halleck’s kindjal thrust under the table’s edge, the
				tip almost touching Paul’s groin.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-717">
				“We’d have joined each other in death,” Halleck said. “But I’ll admit
				you fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the
				<i class="calibre2">mood.</i>” And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine
				scar rippling along his jaw.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-718">
				“The way you came at me,” Paul said. “Would you really have drawn my
				blood?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-719">
				Halleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. “If you’d fought one whit
				beneath your abilities, I’d have scratched you a good one, a scar you’d
				remember. I’ll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen
				tramp who happens along.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-720">
				Paul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-721"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="57"></span
				>his breath. “I deserved that, Gurney. But it would’ve angered my father
				if you’d hurt me. I’ll not have you punished for my failing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-722">
				“As to that,” Halleck said, “it was my failing, too. And you needn’t
				worry about a training scar or two. You’re lucky you have so few. As to
				your father&mdash;the Duke’d punish me only if I failed to make a
				first-class fighting man out of you. And I’d have been failing there if
				I hadn’t explained the fallacy in this
				<i class="calibre2">mood</i> thing you’ve suddenly developed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-723">
				Paul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-724">
				“It’s not exactly play we do here,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-725">
				Paul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic
				seriousness in Halleck’s manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at
				the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man’s jaw, remembering the story of
				how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on
				Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck
				even for an instant. It occurred to Paul, then, that the making of
				Halleck’s scar had been accompanied by pain&mdash;a pain as intense,
				perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought
				aside; it chilled their world.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-726">
				“I guess I did hope for some play today,” Paul said. “Things are so
				serious around here lately.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-727">
				Halleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes.
				There was pain in him&mdash;like a blister, all that was left of some
				lost yesterday that Time had pruned off him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-728">
				<i class="calibre2">How soon this child must assume his manhood</i>,

				<i class="calibre2"
					>How

					caution, to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: “Please
					list your next of kin.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-730">
				Halleck spoke without turning: “I sensed the play in you, lad, and I’d
				like nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play.
				Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-731">
				Paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-732">
				Halleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He
				gestured to the practice dummy. “Now, we’ll work on your timing. Let me
				see you catch that thing sinister. I’ll control it from over here where
				I can have a full view of the action. And I warn you I’ll be trying new
				counters today. There’s a warning you’d not get from a real enemy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-733">
				Paul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn
				with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift
				changes. He crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with
				his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-734">
				“En garde!” Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-735">
				Paul activated his shield, parried and countered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-736">
				Halleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in
				two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other
				wandering in fly-buzz.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-737">
				<i class="calibre2">I’m the well-trained fruit tree</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted
					onto me&mdash;all bearing for someone else to pick.</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-738">
				For some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her
				<span

				pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She had loved pansies…or was it
				daisies? He couldn’t remember. It bothered him that he couldn’t
				remember.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-740">
				Paul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand
				<i class="calibre2">entretisser</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-741">
				<i class="calibre2">The clever little devil!</i> Halleck thought, intent

				<i class="calibre2"
					>He’s been practicing and studying on his own. That’s not Duncan
					style, and it’s certainly nothing I’ve taught him.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-742">
				This thought only added to Halleck’s sadness.
				<i class="calibre2">I’m infected by mood</i>, he thought. And he began
				to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow
				throbbing in the night.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-743">
				“If wishes were fishes we’d all cast nets,” he murmured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-744">
				It was his mother’s expression and he always used it when he felt the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-750">
				“You do look comfortable,” said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-751">
				Paul raised his head, saw the man’s stick figure standing several paces
				away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block
				of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of
				Imperial Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the
				Suk School’s silver ring at the left shoulder.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-757">
				Paul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father
				would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the
				Emperor’s command to take over the fief of Arrakis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-758">
				Yueh crossed to the ell table, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh,
					such a sad waste.</i
				>
				And he reminded himself:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer
					can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-759">
				Paul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. “What’ll I be
				studying on the way across?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-760">
				“Ah-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have
				opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It’s not clear how. I
				must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive&mdash;a Dr.
				Kynes&mdash;and offer my help in the investigation.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-761">
				And Yueh thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-762">
				“Will there be something on the Fremen?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-763">
				“The Fremen?” Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring
				at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-764">
				“Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-765">
				“Yes, to be sure,” Yueh said. “There are two general separations of the
				people&mdash;Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people
				of the graben, the sink, and
				<span

					id="calibre_link-766"

				>the pan. There’s some intermarriage, I’m told. The women of pan and
				sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives.
				They have a saying: ‘Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the
				desert.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-767">
				“Do you have pictures of them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-768">
				“I’ll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course,
				is their eyes&mdash;totally blue, no whites in them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-769">“Mutation?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-770">
				“No; it’s linked to saturation of the blood with melange.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-771">
				“The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-772">
				“By all accounts,” Yueh said. “They compose poems to their knives. Their
				women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and
				dangerous. You’ll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-773">
				Paul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power
				of words that caught his entire attention.
				<i class="calibre2">What a people to win as allies!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-774">“And the worms?” Paul asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-775">“What?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-776">
				“I’d like to study more about the sandworms.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-777">
				“Ah-h-h, to be sure. I’ve a filmbook on a small specimen, only one
				hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was
				taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters
				in length have been recorded by reliable witnesses, and there’s reason
				to believe even larger ones exist.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-778">
				Paul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the
				<span

				>northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. “The desert belt and
				south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-780">“And the storms.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-781">
				“But any place can be made habitable.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-782">
				“If it’s economically feasible,” Yueh said. “Arrakis has many costly
				perils.” He smoothed his drooping mustache. “Your father will be here
				soon. Before I go, I’ve a gift for you, something I came across in
				packing.” He put an object on the table between them&mdash;black,
				oblong, no larger than the end of Paul’s thumb.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-783">
				Paul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and
				thought: <i class="calibre2">How cautious he is.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-784">
				“It’s a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a
				filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own
				magnifier and electrostatic charge system.” He picked it up,
				demonstrated. “The book is held closed by the charge, which forces
				against spring-locked covers. You press the edge&mdash;thus, and the
				pages you’ve selected repel each other and the book opens.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-785">“It’s so small.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-786">
				“But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge&mdash;thus, and
				so…and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never
				touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too
				delicate.” He closed the book, handed it to Paul. “Try it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-787">
				Yueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before
					betraying him. Thus may I say to myself that he has gone where I
					cannot go.</i

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-790">
				“It’s quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it
				too valuable for one so young.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-791">
				And Yueh thought:
				<i class="calibre2">His mother would surely wonder at my motives.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-792">
				“Well….” Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. “If it’s so
				valuable….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-793">
				“Indulge an old man’s whim,” Yueh said. “It was given to me when I was
				very young.” And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2">I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity.</i>
				“Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima&mdash;where it says: ‘From water
				does all life begin.’ There’s a slight notch on the edge of the cover to
				mark the place.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-794">
				Paul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other.
				He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its
				magnifier sliding into place.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-795">“Read it aloud,” Yueh said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-796">
				Paul wet his lips with his tongue, read: “‘Think you of the fact that a
				deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess?
				What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world
				all around us? What is there around us that we cannot&mdash;’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-797">“Stop it!” Yueh barked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-798">Paul broke off, stared at him.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-799">
				Yueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite
					passage?</i
				>
				He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-800">
				“Is something wrong?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-801">
				“I’m sorry,” Yueh said. “That was…my…dead
				<span

				>wife’s favorite passage. It’s not the one I intended you to read. It
				brings up memories that are…painful.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-803">
				“There are two notches,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-804">
				<i class="calibre2">Of course</i>, Yueh thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine
					and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-805">
				“You may find the book interesting,” Yueh said. “It has much historical
				truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-806">
				Paul looked down at the tiny book in his palm&mdash;such a small thing.
				Yet, it contained a mystery…something had happened while he read from
				it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-807">
				“Your father will be here any minute,” Yueh said. “Put the book away and
				read it at your leisure.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-808">
				Paul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed
				itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had
				barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book’s return.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-809">
				“I thank you for the gift, Dr. Yueh,” Paul said, speaking formally. “It
				will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please
				do not hesitate to ask.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-810">
				“I…need for nothing,” Yueh said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-811">
				And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2">Why do I stand here torturing myself</i

				<i class="calibre2">here</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-817">
				The Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-821">
				“Not very hard,” Paul said. “Everything’s so….” He shrugged.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-822">
				“Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It’ll be good to get settled in our new

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-823">
				Paul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother’s words:
				“<i class="calibre2">…for the father, nothing.</i>”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-824">
				“Father,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-825">
				The Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of
				the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his
				mind&mdash;the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his
				men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized,
				confronted by the single thought:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-826">
				<i class="calibre2">This is my son.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-827">
				“It’ll be dangerous,” he admitted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-828">
				“Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,” Paul said. And he

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-829">
				The Duke noted his son’s distress, said: “As always, Hawat sees the main
				chance. But there’s much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober
				Advancer Mercantiles&mdash;the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His
				Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship…a subtle gain.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-830">
				“CHOAM controls the spice,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-831">
				“And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,” the Duke said.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-834">
				“Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,” the
				Duke said. “Don’t let a woman’s fears cloud your mind. No woman wants

				“Few products escape the CHOAM touch,” the Duke said. “Logs, donkeys,
				horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur&mdash;the most prosaic and
				the most exotic…even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the
				Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse
				and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home
				on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is
				unique and it has true geriatric properties.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-840">“And now we control it?”</p>

				“Others would be out in the cold.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-844">
				The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his

				“The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-845">
				“They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-846">
				“They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,” the Duke said. “Think
				of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of
				leadership&mdash;their unofficial spokesman. Think how they’d react if I
				were responsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all,
				one’s own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can’t

				“They’d look the other way no matter <i class="calibre2">what</i> was

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-847">
				“Even if we were attacked with atomics?”

				“Then why are we walking into this?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-850">
				“Paul!” The Duke frowned at his son. “Knowing where the trap

				The metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father’s breast

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-881">
				“We’re negotiating with the Fremen right now,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-882">
				“I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,” the Duke said. “A proud and

				moral.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-883">
				“Duncan, the moral,” Paul said, “and Gurney the valorous.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-884">
				“You name them well,” the Duke said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-885">

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-886">
				“Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-887">“That isn’t what he told me.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-888">
				The Duke laughed aloud. “I figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise.
				He says you have a nicety of awareness&mdash;in his own words&mdash;of
				the difference between a blade’s edge and its tip.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-889">
				“Gurney says there’s no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should
				be done with the edge.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-890">
				“Gurney’s a romantic,” the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly

				rain was drumming.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-892">
				Seeing the direction of his father’s stare, Paul thought of the wet
				skies out there&mdash;a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all

				beyond. “Are the Guild ships really big?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-893">
				The Duke looked at him. “This <i class="calibre2">will</i> be your first
				time off planet,” he said. “Yes, they’re big. We’ll be riding a
				Heighliner because it’s a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold
				will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little
				corner&mdash;we’ll be just a small part of the ship’s manifest.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-894">
				“And we won’t be able to leave our frigates?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-895">
				“That’s part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be
				Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we’d have nothing to fear from

				privileges.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-896">
				“I’m going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-897">
				“You won’t. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild’s as

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-898">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-899">
				“Who knows?” The Duke shrugged. “It’s a mystery we’re not likely to
				solve. We’ve more immediate problems&mdash;among them: you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-900">“Me?”</p>

				have Mentat capabilities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-903">
				Paul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: “A
				Mentat? Me? But I….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-904">
				“Hawat agrees, Son. It’s true.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-905">
				“But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the
				subject couldn’t be told because it might inhibit the early….” He broke
				off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing
				computation. “I see,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-906">
				“A day comes,” the Duke said, “when the potential Mentat must learn
				what’s being done. It may no longer be done
				<i class="calibre2">to</i> him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of
				whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are
				incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about
				himself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-907">
				Paul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his
				mother&mdash;the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle
				control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and
				nuances of voices&mdash;all of it clicked into a new kind of
				understanding in his mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-908">
				“You’ll be the Duke someday, Son,” his father said. “A Mentat Duke would
				be formidable indeed. Can you decide now…or do you need more time?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-909">
				There was no hesitation in his answer. “I’ll go on with the training.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-910">
				“Formidable indeed,” the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on

				cartons, cases&mdash;some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo
				handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-918">
				Jessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-919"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="77"></span
				>slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and
				deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her
				of the Sisters’ Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the
				effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-920">
				Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed
				walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two
				stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped
				here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system
				grew trees to make such beams&mdash;unless the beams were imitation
				wood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-921">She thought not.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-922">
				This had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire.
				Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the
				Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag&mdash;a cheap and brassy
				place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto
				had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name,
				Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a
				smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-923">
				Again there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry.
				Jessica sighed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-924">
				Against a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke’s father.
				Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the
				twine was still clutched in Jessica’s left hand. Beside the painting lay
				a black bull’s head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark
				island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-925"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="78"></span
				>and the bull’s shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast
				were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-926">
				Jessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two
				things first&mdash;the head and the painting. She knew there was
				something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke’s
				buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and
				unsure of herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-927">The head and the picture.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-928">
				They heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the
				slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in
				these latitudes the sky looked black and cold&mdash;so much darker than
				the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-929">
				<i class="calibre2">So far away, Caladan.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-930">“Here we are!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-931">The voice was Duke Leto’s.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-932">
				She whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining
				hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the
				breast looked dusty and rumpled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-933">
				“I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-934">
				“It is a cold house,” she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark
				skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters.
				There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory:
				thin, full of sharp angles and planes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-935">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-936"

				>A sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage,
				driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor’s command.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-937">
				“The whole city feels cold,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-938">
				“It’s a dirty, dusty little garrison town,” he agreed. “But we’ll change
				that.” He looked around the hall. “These are public rooms for state
				occasions. I’ve just glanced at some of the family apartments in the
				south wing. They’re much nicer.” He stepped closer, touched her arm,
				admiring her stateliness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-939">
				And again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry&mdash;a renegade House,
				perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the
				Emperor’s own blood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-940">
				Under the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her
				profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that
				brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the
				color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as
				the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and
				generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone
				to slimness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-941">
				He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny,
				so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had
				brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that
				Paul favored her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-942">“Where’s Paul?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-943">
				“Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-944">
				“Probably in the south wing,” he said. “I thought I
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-945"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="80"></span
				>heard Yueh’s voice, but I couldn’t take time to look.” He glanced down
				at her, hesitating. “I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle
				in the dining hall.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-946">
				She caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging
				the key&mdash;there was finality in that action. But this was not the
				time or place for comforting. “I saw our banner over the house as we
				came in,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-947">
				He glanced at the painting of his father. “Where were you going to hang
				that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-948">“Somewhere in here.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-949">
				“No.” The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery
				to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even
				if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-950">
				“My Lord,” she said, “if you’d only….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-951">
				“The answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in
				this. I’ve just come from the dining hall where there are&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-952">“My Lord! Please.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-953">
				“The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my
				dear,” he said. “They will hang in the dining hall.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-954">She sighed. “Yes, my Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-955">
				“You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. I
				shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-956">“Thank you, my Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-957">
				“And don’t go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-960">
				“Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,” he
				said. “There’s a portable in your room.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-961">
				“You anticipated this…disagreement,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-962">
				“My dear, I think also of your comfort. I’ve engaged servants. They’re
				locals, but Hawat has cleared them&mdash;they’re Fremen all. They’ll do
				until our own people can be released from their other duties.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-963">
				“Can anyone from this place be truly safe?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-964">
				“Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-965">
				“Shadout,” Jessica said. “A Fremen title?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-966">
				“I’m told it means ‘well-dipper,’ a meaning with rather important
				overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat
				speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan’s report. They’re convinced
				she wants to serve&mdash;specifically that she wants to serve you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-967">“Me?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-968">
				“The Fremen have learned that you’re Bene Gesserit,” he said. “There are

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-969">
				<i class="calibre2">The Missionaria Protectiva</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2">No place escapes them.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-970">
				“Does this mean Duncan was successful?” she asked. “Will the Fremen be
				our allies?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-971">
				“There’s nothing definite,” he said. “They wish to observe us for a
				while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our
				outlying villages during a truce period. That’s a more important gain
				than it might seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep
				<span

				>thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a
				carefully guarded secret. It wouldn’t have helped for the Emperor to
				learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-973">
				“A Fremen housekeeper,” Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the
				Shadout Mapes. “She’ll have the all-blue eyes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-974">
				“Don’t let the appearance of these people deceive you,” he said.
				“There’s a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they’ll
				be everything we need.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-975">
				“It’s a dangerous gamble,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-976">
				“Let’s not go into that again,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-977">
				She forced a smile. “We <i class="calibre2">are</i> committed, no doubt

				anything special I should reserve for you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-978">
				“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said, “the way you

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-979">
				“It’s a female thing,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-980">
				He smiled. “Well, assignment of rooms: make certain I have large office
				space next to my sleeping quarters. There’ll be more paper work here

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-981">“I’m sure they have.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-982">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-992">
				He cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without

				<span

				>the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice

				spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: “The Lady Jessica’s in the
				Great Hall. Join her there immediately.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-994">The outer door slammed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-995">
				Jessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto’s father. It had been
				done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke’s middle years. He
				was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left
				arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto’s now, and with the
				same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her
				sides, glared at the painting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-996">
				“Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!” she whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-997">
				“What are your orders, Noble Born?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-998">
				It was a woman’s voice, thin and stringy.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-999">
				Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a
				shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and
				desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way
				from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this
				planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto
				had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of
				course&mdash;that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any
				white&mdash;secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1000">
				The woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: “I am called the Shadout Mapes,
				Noble Born. What are your orders?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1001">
				“You may refer to me as ‘my Lady,’” Jessica said. “I’m
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1002"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="85"></span
				>not noble born. I’m the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1003">
				Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a
				sly questioning. “There’s a wife, then?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1004">
				“There is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke’s only…companion,
				the mother of his heir-designate.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1005">
				Even as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her
				words. <i class="calibre2">What was it St. Augustine said?</i> she asked
				herself.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1006">
				A weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated:
				“Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!” Then: “Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!” And again:
				“Soo-soo-Sook!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1007">
				“What <i class="calibre2">is</i> that?” Jessica asked. “I heard it
				several times as we drove through the streets this morning.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1008">
				“Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you’ve no need to interest yourself
				in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it’s
				always kept full.” She glanced down at her dress. “Why, you know, my
				Lady, I don’t even have to wear my stillsuit here?” She cackled. “And me
				not even dead!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1009">
				Jessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data
				to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more
				imperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a
				major mark of wealth here.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1012">
				“You know the ancient tongues then?” Mapes asked, and she waited with an
				odd intensity.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1013">
				“Tongues are the Bene Gesserit’s first learning,” Jessica said. “I know
				the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1014">
				Mapes nodded. “Just as the legend says.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1015">
				And Jessica wondered:
				<i class="calibre2">Why do I play out this sham?</i> But the Bene
				Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1016">
				“I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,” Jessica said.
				She read the more obvious signs in Mapes’ actions and appearance, the
				petit betrayals. “Miseces prejia,” she said in the Chakobsa tongue.
				“Andral t’re pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1017">
				Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1018">
				“I know many things,” Jessica said. “I know that you have borne
				children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear
				and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. I know
				many things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1019">
				In a low voice, Mapes said: “I meant no offense, my Lady.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1020">
				“You speak of the legend and seek answers,” Jessica said. “Beware the
				answers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a
				weapon in your bodice.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1021">“My Lady, I….”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1022">
				“There’s a remote possibility you could draw my life’s blood,” Jessica
				said, “but in so doing you’d bring down more ruin than your wildest
				fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you
				know&mdash;even for an entire people.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1023">

				>“My Lady!” Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. “The
				weapon was sent as a gift to <i class="calibre2">you</i> should you
				prove to be the One.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1025">
				“And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise,” Jessica said.
				She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained
				so terrifying in combat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1026">
				<i class="calibre2">Now we see which way the decision tips</i>, she
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1027">
				Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark
				sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She
				took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white
				blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of
				its own. It was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps
				twenty centimeters long.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1028">
				“Do you know this, my Lady?” Mapes asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1029">
				It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of
				Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was
				known only by rumor and wild gossip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1030">“It’s a crysknife,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1031">
				“Say it not lightly,” Mapes said. “Do you know its meaning?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1032">
				And Jessica thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>There was an edge to that question. Here’s the reason this Fremen has
					taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could
					precipitate violence or…what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning

				<span

				>Jessica said: “It’s a maker&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1035">
				“Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!” Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and
				elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of
				reflection shooting around the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1036">
				Jessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a
				<i class="calibre2">maker of death</i> and then add the ancient word,
				but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that
				exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1037">
				The key word was…<i class="calibre2">maker.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1038">
				<i class="calibre2">Maker? Maker.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1039">
				Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1040">
				Jessica said: “Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great
				Mother, would not know the Maker?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1041">
				Mapes lowered the knife. “My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for
				so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1042">
				Jessica thought about the prophecy&mdash;the Shari-a and all the
				panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva
				dropped here long centuries ago&mdash;long dead, no doubt, but her
				purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people
				against the day of a Bene Gesserit’s need.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1043">Well, that day had come.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1044">
				Mapes returned knife to sheath, said: “This is an unfixed blade, my
				Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins
				to disintegrate. It’s yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you
				live.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1045">
				Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: “Mapes, you’ve
				sheathed that blade unblooded.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1046">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1047"

				>With a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica’s hand, tore
				open the brown bodice, wailing: “Take the water of my life!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1048">
				Jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She
				directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic
				come over the woman.
				<i class="calibre2">Poison in the point?</i> Jessica wondered. She
				tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade’s edge above
				Mapes’ left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped
				almost immediately. <i class="calibre2">Ultrafast coagulation</i>,
				Jessica thought. <i class="calibre2">A moisture-conserving mutation?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1049">
				She sheathed the blade, said: “Button your dress, Mapes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1050">
				Mapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. “You
				are ours,” she muttered. “You are the One.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1051">
				There came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes
				grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica’s bodice. “Who sees
				that knife must be cleansed or slain!” she snarled. “You
				<i class="calibre2">know</i> that, my Lady!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1052">
				<i class="calibre2">I know it now</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1053">
				The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1054">
				Mapes composed herself, said: “The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife
				may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You’ve been
				entrusted with a crysknife.” She took a deep breath. “Now the thing must
				take its course. It cannot be hurried.” She glanced at the stacked boxes
				and piled goods around them. “And there’s work aplenty to while the time
				for us here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1055">
				Jessica hesitated. “<i class="calibre2"

				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1057">
				<i class="calibre2">But I’m not a Reverend Mother</i>, Jessica thought.

				<i class="calibre2">one here! This must be a hideous place!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1058">
				In matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: “What’ll you be wanting me to do
				first, my Lady?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1059">
				Instinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The
				painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the
				dining hall. The bull’s head must go on the wall opposite the painting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1060">
				Mapes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a great beast it must have been
				to carry such a head,” she said. She stooped. “I’ll have to be cleaning
				this first, won’t I, my Lady?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1061">“No.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1062">
				“But there’s dirt caked on its horns.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1063">
				“That’s not dirt, Mapes. That’s the blood of our Duke’s father. Those
				horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this
				beast killed the Old Duke.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1064">
				Mapes stood up. “Ah, now!” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1065">
				“It’s just blood,” Jessica said. “Old blood at that. Get some help
				hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1066">
				“Did you think the blood bothered me?” Mapes asked. “I’m of the desert
				and I’ve seen blood aplenty.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1067">
				“I…see that you have,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1068">
				“And some of it my own,” Mapes said. “More’n you drew with your puny
				scratch.”
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1072">
				And Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications
				in the phrase, “the body’s water.” Again she felt a sense of oppression
				at the importance of water on Arrakis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1073">
				“On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these
				pretties, my Lady?” Mapes asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1074">
				<i class="calibre2">Ever the practical one, this Mapes</i>, Jessica
				thought. She said: “Use your own judgment, Mapes. It makes no real
				difference.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1075">
				“As you say, my Lady.” Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine
				from the head. “Killed an old duke, did you?” she crooned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1076">
				“Shall I summon a handler to help you?” Jessica asked.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1079">
				Jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice,
				thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged
				another link here. Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly
				crisis. “It cannot be hurried,” Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of
				headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And
				not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat’s
				suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the
				feeling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1080">
				“When you’ve finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,” Jessica
				said. “One of the cargo men at

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1082">
				“As you will, my Lady,” Mapes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1083">
				Jessica turned away, thinking:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1084">
				An urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward
				the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the
				family wings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1085">
				Behind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull’s head,
				looked at the retreating back. “She’s the One all right,” she muttered.

				more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs. At the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1092">
				She saw that Yueh’s coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left

				sorry for you, I’m afraid I think of you as…well, Jessica.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1103">“Sorry for me? Whatever for?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1104">
				Yueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the
				full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth
				with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1105">
				“You’ve seen this place, my…Jessica.” He stumbled over the name, plunged
				ahead: “So barren after Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we
				passed on the
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1106"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="95"></span
				>way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1107">
				She folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the
				crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm’s tooth, if the reports
				were right. “It’s just that we’re strange to them&mdash;different
				people, different customs. They’ve known only the Harkonnens.” She
				looked past him out the windows. “What were you staring at out there?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1108">
				He turned back to the window. “The people.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1109">
				Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the
				house where Yueh’s attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees
				grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence
				separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing.
				Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the
				people&mdash;a house shield&mdash;and went on to study the passing
				throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1110">
				The pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing
				people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate…even a sense of
				hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1111">
				“Do you know what they’re thinking?” Yueh asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1112">
				“You profess to read minds?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1113">
				“Those minds,” he said. “They look at those trees and they think: ‘There
				are one hundred of us.’ That’s what they think.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1114">
				She turned a puzzled frown on him. “Why?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1115">
				“Those are date palms,” he said. “One date palm requires forty liters of
				water a day. A man requires but
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1116"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="96"></span
				>eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out
				there&mdash;one hundred men.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1117">
				“But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1118">
				“They but hope some dates will fall, except it’s the wrong season.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1119">
				“We look at this place with too critical an eye,” she said. “There’s
				hope as well as danger here. The spice
				<i class="calibre2">could</i> make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can
				make this world into whatever we wish.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1120">
				And she laughed silently at herself:
				<i class="calibre2">Who am I trying to convince?</i> The laugh broke
				through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. “But you can’t
				buy security,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1121">
				Yueh turned away to hide his face from her.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>If only it were possible to hate these people instead of love
					them!</i
				>
				In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like his Wanna. Yet that
				thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose. The ways
				of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had
				to be certain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1122">
				“Do not worry for us, Wellington,” Jessica said. “The problem’s ours,
				not yours.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1123">
				<i class="calibre2">She thinks I worry for her!</i> He blinked back
				tears.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>And I do, of course. But I must stand before that black Baron with
					his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him where he
					is weakest&mdash;in his gloating moment!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1124">He sighed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1125">
				“Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1126">
				“Not at all. I gave him a sedative.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1127">
				“He’s taking the change well?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1128">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1129"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="97"></span
				>“Except for getting a bit overtired. He’s excited, but what
				fifteen-year-old wouldn’t be under these circumstances?” He crossed to
				the door, opened it. “He’s in here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1130">
				Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1131">
				Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other
				thrown back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed
				wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1132">
				Jessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her
				own. But the hair was the Duke’s&mdash;coal-colored and tousled. Long
				lashes concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears
				retreat. She was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her
				son’s features&mdash;her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp
				touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity
				emerging from childhood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1133">
				She thought of the boy’s features as an exquisite distillation out of
				random patterns&mdash;endless queues of happenstance meeting at this
				nexus. The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her
				son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh’s presence. She stepped
				back, closed the door softly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1134">
				Yueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica
				stared at her son.
				<i class="calibre2">Why did Wanna never give me children?</i> he asked
				himself.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there
					some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a
					different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me,
					certainly.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1135">
				For the first time, he was caught up in the thought
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1136"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="98"></span
				>that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than
				his mind could grasp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1137">
				Jessica stopped beside him, said: “What delicious abandon in the sleep
				of a child.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1138">
				He spoke mechanically: “If only adults could relax like that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1139">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1140">
				“Where do we lose it?” he murmured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1141">
				She glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on
				Paul, thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the
				differences in his life now&mdash;so very different from the life they
				once had planned for him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1142">
				“We do, indeed, lose something,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1143">
				She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled
				gray-green of bushes&mdash;dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The
				too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the
				Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast&mdash;light like the crysknife
				concealed in her bodice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1144">
				“The sky’s so dark,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1145">
				“That’s partly the lack of moisture,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1146">
				“Water!” she snapped. “Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with
				the lack of water!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1147">
				“It’s the precious mystery of Arrakis,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1148">
				“Why is there so little of it? There’s volcanic rock here. There’re a
				dozen power sources I could name. There’s polar ice. They say you can’t
				drill in the desert&mdash;storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster
				than it can be installed, if the worms don’t get you first. They’ve
				never found water traces there, anyway. But the mystery,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1149"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="99"></span
				>Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that’ve been drilled up here
				in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1150">
				“First a trickle, then nothing,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1151">
				“But, Wellington, that’s the mystery. The water was there. It dries up.
				And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the
				same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about
				this?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1152">
				“It is curious,” he said. “You suspect some living agency? Wouldn’t that
				have shown in core samples?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1153">
				“What would have shown? Alien plant matter…or animal? Who could
				recognize it?” She turned back to the slope. “The water is stopped.
				Something plugs it. That’s my suspicion.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1154">
				“Perhaps the reason’s known,” he said. “The Harkonnens sealed off many
				sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to
				suppress this.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1155">
				“What reason?” she asked. “And then there’s the atmospheric moisture.
				Little enough of it, certainly, but there’s some. It’s the major source
				of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that
				come from?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1156">“The polar caps?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1157">
				“Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here
				behind the Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of
				those things are directly involved with the spice.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1158">
				“We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,” he said. “Perhaps we’ll….” He
				broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. “Is
				something wrong?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1159">
				“The way you say ‘Harkonnen,’” she said. “Even my
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1160"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="100"></span
				>Duke’s voice doesn’t carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated
				name. I didn’t know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1161">
				<i class="calibre2">Great Mother!</i> he thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’ve aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna
					taught me. There’s only one solution: tell the truth as far as I
					can.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1162">
				He said: “You didn’t know that my wife, my Wanna….” He shrugged, unable
				to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: “They….” The
				words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly,
				experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched
				his arm gently.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1163">
				“Forgive me,” Jessica said. “I did not mean to open an old wound.” And
				she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit&mdash;the signs are all
					over him. And it’s obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here’s another
					poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1164">
				“I am sorry,” he said. “I’m unable to talk about it.” He opened his
				eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at
				least, was truth.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1165">
				Jessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of
				almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a
				curved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his
				cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A
				deep affection for him came over her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1166">
				“Wellington, I’m sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,” she
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1167">
				“I came willingly,” he said. And that, too, was true.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1168">
				“But this whole planet’s a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1169">
				<span

				>“It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,” he said. And
				that, too, was true.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1171">
				“Perhaps I should be more confident of him,” she said. “He is a
				brilliant tactician.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1172">
				“We’ve been uprooted,” he said. “That’s why we’re uneasy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1173">
				“And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant,” she said. “Especially
				when you put it down in hostile soil.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1174">
				“Are we certain the soil’s hostile?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1175">
				“There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was
				adding to the population,” she said. “They stopped only when the people
				learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of
				the load.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1176">
				“There is only so much water to support human life here,” he said. “The
				people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price
				goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn’t
				follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1177">
				“And guards,” she said. “Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the
				blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on
				Caladan.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1178">
				“Give this planet a chance,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1179">
				But Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. “I can smell
				death in this place,” she said. “Hawat sent advance agents in here by
				the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are
				his men. There’ve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the
				treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.” She
				shook her head. “Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1180">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1181"

					title="102"></span
				>“You malign him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1182">
				“Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just
				do not fool myself about Thufir’s methods.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1183">
				“You should…keep busy,” he said. “Give yourself no time for such
				morbid&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1184">
				“Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the
				Duke’s secretary&mdash;so busy that each day I learn new things to
				fear…things even he doesn’t suspect I know.” She compressed her lips,
				spoke thinly: “Sometimes I wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business
				training figured in his choice of me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1185">
				“What do you mean?” He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the
				bitterness that he had never seen her expose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1186">
				“Don’t you think, Wellington,” she asked, “that a secretary bound to one
				by love is so much safer?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1187">
				“That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1188">
				The rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke
				felt about his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her
				with his eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1189">
				She sighed. “You’re right. It’s not worthy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1190">
				Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her
				flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1191">
				“There’ll be much bloodshed soon,” she said. “The Harkonnens won’t rest
				until they’re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that
				Leto is a cousin of the royal blood&mdash;no matter what the
				distance&mdash;while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM
				pocketbook.
				<span

				>But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an
				Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of
				Corrin.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1193">
				“The old feud,” Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of
				hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna
				or&mdash;worse&mdash;left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband
				did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were
				part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should
				come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of
				melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1194">
				“What are you thinking?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1195">
				“I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand
				solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy
				many things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1196">
				“Does greed touch even you, Wellington?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1197">“Not greed.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1198">“What then?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1199">
				He shrugged. “Futility.” He glanced at her. “Can you remember your first
				taste of spice?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1200">“It tasted like cinnamon.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1201">
				“But never twice the same,” he said. “It’s like life&mdash;it presents a
				different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces
				a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it,
				interprets the flavor as pleasurable&mdash;slightly euphoric. And, like
				life, never to be truly synthesized.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1202">
				“I think it would’ve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves
				beyond the Imperial reach,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1203">

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1205">
				He spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: “Would
				you think it bold of me…Jessica, if I asked a personal question?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1206">
				She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of
				disquiet. “Of course not. You’re…my friend.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1207">
				“Why haven’t you made the Duke marry you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1208">
				She whirled, head up, glaring. “Made him marry me? But&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1209">
				“I should not have asked,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1210">
				“No.” She shrugged. “There’s good political reason&mdash;as long as my
				Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for
				alliance. And….” She sighed. “…motivating people, forcing them to your
				will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades
				everything it touches. If I made him do…this, then it would not be his
				doing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1211">
				“It’s a thing my Wanna might have said,” he murmured. And this, too, was
				truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never
				been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1212">
				Jessica spoke, shattering the moment. “Besides, Wellington, the Duke is
				really two men. One of them I love very much. He’s charming, witty,
				considerate…tender&mdash;everything a woman could desire. But the other
				man is…cold, callous, demanding, selfish&mdash;as harsh and cruel as a
				winter wind. That’s the man shaped by the father.”
				<span

				>Her face contorted. “If only that old man had died when my Duke was

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1214">
				In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could
				be heard fingering the blinds.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1215">
				Presently, she took a deep breath, said, “Leto’s right&mdash;these rooms
				are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.” She turned,
				sweeping the room with her gaze. “If you’ll excuse me, Wellington, I
				want another look through this wing before I assign quarters.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1216">
				He nodded. “Of course.” And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>If only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1217">
				Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a
				moment, hesitating, then let herself out.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>All the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something
					back</i
				>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">To save my feelings, no doubt. He’s a good man.</i>

				that would turn on the room’s suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when
				twisted, controlled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1227">
				Quietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to
				his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1236">
				Now was the moment to go exploring.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1237">
				Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened
				into the closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved
				headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been
				sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1238">
				From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five
				centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once&mdash;a common
				assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an
				early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand
				and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve
				channels to the nearest vital organ.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1239">
				The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1240">
				Through Paul’s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker
				limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to
				reflect his target, the operator would be relying on
				motion&mdash;anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give
				time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed.
				Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and
				notoriously cranky of maintenance&mdash;and there was always the peril
				of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield.
				The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1241">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1249">
				Paul’s right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It
				hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in

				against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye
				smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand.

				“Go to my father’s men,” he said. “Tell them I’ve caught a hunter-seeker

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1271">
				Paul absorbed this in silence: <i class="calibre2">a traitor</i>. Before
				he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the
				entry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1272">
				He thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1273">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1281">
				<i class="calibre2">Oval?</i> she wondered.
				<i class="calibre2">What an odd shape for a door in a house.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1282">
				Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great

				picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1283">
				Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under

				there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should
				have been.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1284">
				<i class="calibre2">Surely not a palm lock</i>, she told herself.

				But it looked like a palm lock. And there were ways to open any palm

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1286">
				Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm
				against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to
				distort the lines&mdash;a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding
				twist of the palm across the surface.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1287">She felt the click.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1288">
				But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica
				lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the
				stairs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1289">
				“There are men in the great hall say they’ve been sent by the Duke to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1290">
				<i class="calibre2">A cautious one, this Mapes</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2">That’s a good sign.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1291">
				“He’s in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,”
				Jessica said. “If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1292">
				Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought
				she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about
				the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back
				down the hall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1293">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1298">

				<i class="calibre2">Special climate!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1300">
				That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1301">
				The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it
				open securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the
				wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the
				metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1302">
				“O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God’s Creation; then, stand before
				it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1303">
				Jessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door
				opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt
				change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked
				through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1304">
				<i class="calibre2">A yellow sun?</i> she asked herself. Then:
				<i class="calibre2">Filter glass!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1305">
				She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1311">
				Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1312">
				She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center
				of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The
				rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling
				thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1313">
				Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a
				methodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared to be about
				ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from
				subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto
				the roof of this wing long after the original building’s completion.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1314">
				She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach
				of filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was
				crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the
				greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe
				and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that
				misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had
				watered: a fern tree.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1315">
				Water everywhere in this room&mdash;on a planet where water was the most

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1317">
				She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged
				horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting
				known as the Shield Wall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1318">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1319">
				She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock
				doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had
				said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to
				ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against
				the omnipresent dust.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1320">
				But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of
				waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used
				water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis&mdash;possibly
				more.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1321">
				Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The
				move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the
				fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly
				concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted
				Hawat’s daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:

				Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor’s

				out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained
				the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was
				required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: “On
				that path lies danger.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1330">
				Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots.
				Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing.
				She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1331">
				<i class="calibre2">Something in the position of the pad?</i> she
				wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1332">
				But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She
				looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along
				the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her
				fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single
				passage:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1333">
				“Your son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been
				designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be
				discovered, leaving one
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1334"

				>that may escape detection.” Jessica put down the urge to run back to
				Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the
				dots: “I do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has
				something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection
				of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to
				a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe.
				Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not
				in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1335">
				Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that
				instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding
				something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his
				mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain,
				thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1336">
				“Paul!” She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. “What is that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1337">
				He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone:
				“Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to
				be sure. Water should short it out.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1338">“Immerse it!” she commanded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1339">He obeyed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1340">
				Presently, she said: “Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1341">
				He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent
				metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the
				deadly sliver.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1342">It was dead.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1343">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1350">

				“That can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s safe?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1354">He relaxed slightly.</p>

				“The housekeeper said you’d be here.” He glanced around the room. “We

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1361">
				“I’ll want to take part in the interrogation,” Jessica said.
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1364">
				“We’ve found nothing yet, my Lady.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1365">
				“Was he an Arrakeen native?” Paul asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1366">
				Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1367">
				“He has the native look,” the man said. “Put into that cairn more’n a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1374">

			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1381">
				“Do you distrust Hawat?” she asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1382">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1383">
				“That’d only shame him and impair his efficiency,” she said. “A stray

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1384">
				“We must take our own measures,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1385">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1394">
				And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1395">
				“My father must learn of this at once,” he said. “I’ll radiograph it in

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1396">
				“No,” she said. “You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1397">
				“Do you mean we should trust no one?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1398">
				“There’s another possibility,” she said. “This message may have been

				but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1399">
				Paul’s face remained sturdily somber. “To sow distrust and suspicion in
				our ranks, to weaken us that way,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1400">
				“You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1401">“I understand.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1402">
				She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the

				above the cliffs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1403">
				Paul turned with her, said: “I don’t think it’s Hawat, either. Is it

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1404">
				“He’s not a lieutenant or companion,” she said. “And I can assure you he

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1405">
				Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"

				stretched a high-fenced storage yard&mdash;lines of spice silos in it
				with stilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled

				out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall&mdash;silos repeated, stuttering
				across the basin.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1408">
				Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped
				out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with
				a clear, precise rhythm&mdash;a trembling of light:
				blink-blink-blink-blink-blink…

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1409">
				Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1410">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1411">
				<i class="calibre2">Someone signaling!</i>

				Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1414">And it was gone.</p>

				The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1457">
				Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one
				shoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutched in the other
				hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny
				movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1458">
				The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the
				glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a
				man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every
				precept. What was it Paul had called him?
				<i class="calibre2">“Gurney, the valorous.”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1459">
				Halleck’s wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots

				>on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the
				scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with
				a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability.
				He came up to the Duke, bowed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1461">“Gurney,” Leto said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1462">
				“My Lord.” He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room.
				“This is the last of them. I’d have preferred coming in with the first
				wave, but….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1463">
				“There are still some Harkonnens for you,” the Duke said. “Step aside
				with me, Gurney, where we may talk.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1464">“Yours to command, my Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1465">
				They moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men
				stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a
				corner, kept his grip on the baliset.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1466">
				“How many men can you let Hawat have?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1467">“Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1468">
				“He’s lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent
				line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a
				measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many
				men as you can spare&mdash;men who won’t balk at a little knife work.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1469">
				“I can let him have three hundred of my best,” Halleck said. “Where
				shall I send them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1470">
				“To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1471">
				“Shall I get about it at once, Sire?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1472">
				“In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold
				the shuttle here until dawn on a
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1473"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="130"></span
				>pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its
				business, and the shuttle’s supposed to make contact with a cargo ship
				taking up a load of spice.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1474">“Our spice, m’Lord?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1475">
				“Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters
				from the old regime. They’ve opted to leave with the change of fief and
				the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers,
				Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must
				persuade some of those men to enlist with us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1476">
				“How strong a persuasion, Sire?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1477">
				“I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and
				skills we need. The fact that they’re leaving suggests they’re not part
				of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones
				planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1478">
				“Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m’Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1479">
				“And there are some he hasn’t found. But I think planting sleepers in
				this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1480">
				“Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1481">
				“Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and
				play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You
				may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per
				cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1482">
				“No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men
				with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on
				them…well, Sire,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1483"

				>twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1484">
				Leto spoke impatiently: “Then use your own discretion in particular
				cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless. Hold it to
				twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers,
				weather scanners, dune men&mdash;any with open sand experience.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1485">
				“I understand, Sire. ‘They shall come all for violence: their faces
				shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of
				the sand.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1486">
				“A very moving quotation,” the Duke said. “Turn your crew over to a
				lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed
				the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field
				personnel will direct them. And don’t forget the men for Hawat.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1487">
				“Three hundred of the best, Sire.” He took up his spacebag. “Where shall
				I report to you when I’ve completed my chores?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1488">
				“I’ve taken over a council room topside here. We’ll hold staff there. I
				want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads
				going out first.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1489">
				Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto’s eye. “Are you
				anticipating <i class="calibre2">that</i> kind of trouble, Sire? I
				thought there was a Judge of the Change here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1490">
				“Both open battle and secret,” the Duke said. “There’ll be blood aplenty
				spilled here before we’re through.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1491">
				“‘And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood
				upon the dry land,’” Halleck quoted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1492">
				The Duke sighed. “Hurry back, Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1493">
				“Very good, m’Lord.” The whipscar rippled to his grin. “‘Behold, as a
				wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.’”
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1494"

				>He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his
				orders, hurried on through the men.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1495">
				Leto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual
				amazement&mdash;a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery
				phrases…and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the
				Harkonnens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1496">
				Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift,
				acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a
				propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed
				to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would
				want to know the women were safe and where they could be found. The
				others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast
				more women than men.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1497">
				The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the
				message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued
				across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with
				a subaltern.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1498">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1499">
				He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could
				turn and face the impersonal doors.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1507">
				The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing
				field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long
				table, old-fashioned three-legged
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1508"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="134"></span
				>chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1509">
				The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: “Hawat told me
				that house was secure!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1510">
				Paul spoke hesitantly: “I was angry, too&mdash;at first. And I blamed

				training given me by you and many others&mdash;including Hawat.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1511">
				“Are you defending him?” the Duke demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1512">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1513">
				“He’s getting old. That’s it. He should be&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1514">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1515">
				“I should be the one defending him,” the Duke said. “Not you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1516">Paul smiled.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1517">
				Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son’s.
				“You’ve…matured lately, Son.” He lifted his hand. “It gladdens me.” He
				matched his son’s smile. “Hawat will punish himself. He’ll direct more
				anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on
				him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1518">
				Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at
				the night’s blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1520">
				The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it
				looking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of
				the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1521">
				“My Lord,” he said, speaking to a point over Leto’s head, “I have just

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1522">
				“Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,” the Duke said. He waved to the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1523">

				<span

					id="calibre_link-1531"

					title="136"></span
				>looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists,

				down the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1532">
				“There’s coffee for those who want it,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1533">
				He looked over his men, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They’re a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of

				He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and
				served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1534">
				Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and
				commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1535">
				“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “our civilization appears to’ve fallen so
				deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple
				order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1536">
				Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father
				had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to
				lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1537">
				“I think first we’d better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his
				report on the Fremen,” the Duke said. “Thufir?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1538">
				Hawat glanced up. “I’ve some economic matters to go into after my
				general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and
				more to be the allies we need. They’re waiting now to see if they can
				trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They’ve sent us a
				gift&mdash;stillsuits of their own manufacture…maps of certain
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1539"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="137"></span
				>desert areas surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind….” He
				glanced down at the table. “Their intelligence reports have proved
				completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with
				the Judge of the Change. They’ve also sent some incidental
				things&mdash;jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy,
				medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be
				no trickery.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1540">
				“You like these people, Thufir?” asked a man down the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1541">
				Hawat turned to face his questioner. “Duncan Idaho says they’re to be
				admired.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1542">
				Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: “Have
				you any new information on how many Fremen there are?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1543">
				Hawat looked at Paul. “From food processing and other evidence, Idaho
				estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand
				people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand
				hearths. We’ve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch
				communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1544">
				“That’s something new,” Leto said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1545">
				“It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this
				Liet may be a local deity.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1546">
				Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: “Is it certain
				they deal with the smugglers?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1547">
				“A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a
				heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an
				eighteen-day journey.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1548">
				“It appears,” the Duke said, “that the smugglers have
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1549"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="138"></span
				>redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves
				some careful thought. We shouldn’t worry too much about unlicensed
				frigates working off our planet&mdash;it’s always done. But to have them
				completely outside our observation&mdash;that’s not good.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1550">
				“You have a plan, Sire,” Hawat asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1551">
				The Duke looked at Halleck. “Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an
				embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them
				I’ll ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe.
				Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore
				required in their operations have been costing them four times that
				amount.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1552">
				“What if the Emperor gets wind of this?” Halleck asked. “He’s very
				jealous of his CHOAM profits, m’Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1553">
				Leto smiled. “We’ll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam
				IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens
				fight that! And we’ll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat
				under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1554">
				A grin twisted Halleck’s face. “Ahh, m’Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would
				that I could see the Baron’s face when he learns of this.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1555">
				The Duke turned to Hawat. “Thufir, did you get those account books you
				said you could buy?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1556">
				“Yes, my Lord. They’re being examined in detail even now. I’ve skimmed
				them, though, and can give a first approximation.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1557">“Give it, then.”</p>

				Halleck murmured: “‘For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and
				of the treasure hid in the sand.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1562">
				“You see, gentlemen,” Leto said. “Is there anyone here so naive he
				believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all
				this merely because the Emperor ordered it?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1563">
				There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1564">
				“We will have to take it at the point of the sword,” Leto said. He
				turned to Hawat. “This’d be a good point to report on equipment. How
				many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment
				have they left us?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1565">
				“A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the
				Judge of the Change, my Lord,” Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to
				pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. “They
				neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that
				only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands&mdash;that
				everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart.
				We’ll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet
				if a fourth of it’s still working six months from now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1566">
				“Pretty much as we expected,” Leto said. “What’s the firm estimate on
				basic equipment?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1567">
				Hawat glanced at his folder. “About nine hundred and thirty harvester

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1569">
				Halleck said: “Wouldn’t it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the
				Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1570">
				The Duke looked at Hawat. “Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?”

				“We must pursue other avenues for now,” Hawat said. “The Guild agent
				wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it
				plain&mdash;one Mentat to another&mdash;that the price was out of our
				reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our
				task is to find out why before we approach him again.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1572">
				One of Halleck’s aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped:
				“There’s no justice in this!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1573">
				“Justice?” The Duke looked at the man. “Who asks for justice? We make
				our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis&mdash;win or die. Do you
				regret casting your lot with us, sir?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1574">
				The man stared at the Duke, then: “No, Sire. You couldn’t turn and I
				could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but….” He
				shrugged. “…we must all feel bitter at times.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1575">
				“Bitterness I understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about
				justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of
				the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly
				council where any man may speak his mind.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1576">
				Halleck stirred, said: “I think what rankles, Sire, is that we’ve had no
				volunteers from the other Great Houses.

				>They address you as ‘Leto the Just’ and promise eternal friendship, but
				only as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1578">
				“They don’t know yet who’s going to win this exchange,” the Duke said.
				“Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly
				blame them for this; one can only despise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We
				were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to
				familiarize the men with this machinery?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1579">
				Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1580">
				A solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of
				the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table
				stood up to get a better look at it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1581">
				Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1582">
				Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was
				about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It
				was basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide
				tracks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1583">
				“This is a harvester factory,” Hawat said. “We chose one in good repair
				for this projection. There’s one dragline outfit that came in with the
				first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it’s still
				running…although I don’t know how…or why.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1584">
				“If that’s the one they call ‘Old Maria,’ it belongs in a museum,” an
				aide said. “I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat
				hanging over their workers’ heads. Be good or you’ll be assigned to Old
				Maria.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1587">
				Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the
				projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the
				image on the table, said: “Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to
				swallow that whole?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1588">
				Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath,
				then thought:
				<i class="calibre2">No&mdash;they have to face the realities here.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1589">
				“There’re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one
				gulp,” Hawat said. “Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the
				spicing’s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory
				and devour it at their leisure.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1590">
				“Why don’t we shield them?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1591">
				“According to Idaho’s report,” Hawat said, “shields are dangerous in the
				desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters
				around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We’ve the Fremen
				word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield
				equipment at the sietch.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1592">“None at all?” Paul asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1593">
				“It’d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several
				thousand people,” Hawat said. “Idaho had free access to every part of
				the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1594">
				“It’s a puzzle,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1595">
				“The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,” Hawat said.
				“They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts
				show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.”
			</p>

				>“Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1598">
				“It doesn’t seem likely,” Hawat said. “It’s theoretically possible, of
				course&mdash;a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the
				trick, but no one’s ever been able to put it to the test.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1599">
				“We’d have heard about it before now,” Halleck said. “The smugglers have
				close contact with the Fremen and would’ve acquired such a device if it
				were available. And they’d have had no inhibitions against marketing it
				off planet.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1600">
				“I don’t like an unanswered question of this importance,” Leto said.
				“Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1601">
				“We’re already working on it, my Lord.” He cleared his throat. “Ah-h,
				Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn’t mistake the Fremen
				attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1602">
				The Duke frowned, then: “The subject under discussion is spicing
				equipment.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1603">
				Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1604">
				The solido-image of the harvester factory was replaced by a projection
				of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it.
				“This is a carryall,” Hawat said. “It’s essentially a large ’thopter,
				whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to
				rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear.
				Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as
				much as possible.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1605">
				“Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,” the Duke said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1608">
				An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1609">
				“These ’thopters are fairly conventional,” Hawat said. “Major
				modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in
				sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty
				is shielded&mdash;possibly discarding the shield generator’s weight for
				greater range.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1610">
				“I don’t like this de-emphasis on shields,” the Duke muttered. And he
				thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won’t even be able to
					escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us?</i
				>
				He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: “Let’s get
				to the working estimate. What’ll our profit figure be?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1611">
				Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. “After assessing the repairs and
				operable equipment, we’ve worked out a first estimate on operating
				costs. It’s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety
				margin.” He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: “Under the
				Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent.
				We’ll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment
				and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and
				military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six
				or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then
				should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it
				belongs.” He opened his eyes. “Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen
				methods.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1612">
				“We’re working for a solid and permanent planetary
				<span

				happy&mdash;especially the Fremen.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1614">
				“Most especially the Fremen,” Hawat agreed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1615">
				“Our supremacy on Caladan,” the Duke said, “depended on sea and air
				power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call
				<i class="calibre2">desert</i> power. This may include air power, but
				it’s possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of ’thopter
				shields.” He shook his head. “The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off
				planet for some of their key personnel. We don’t dare. Each new lot
				would have its quota of provocateurs.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1616">
				“Then we’ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced
				harvest,” Hawat said. “Our output the first two seasons should be down a
				third from the Harkonnen average.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1617">
				“There it is,” the Duke said, “exactly as we expected. We’ll have to
				move fast with the Fremen. I’d like five full battalions of Fremen
				troops before the first CHOAM audit.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1618">
				“That’s not much time, Sire,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1619">
				“We don’t have much time, as you well know. They’ll be here with
				Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1620">
				“Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more, Guild troop-transport

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1621">

				Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the

				“Is there reason to stay?” the Fremen asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1691">
				“We would honor you,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1692">
				“Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon,” the Fremen said. He shot

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1693">
				“If the other Fremen match him, we’ll serve each other well,” Leto said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1698">
				“This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1699">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1700">
				“The knife is ground from a sandworm’s tooth; it’s the mark of the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1726">
				“Sire!” Hawat said. “Those bases are still legally His Majesty’s fief.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1728">
				“’Twere dangerous to commandeer them,” Hawat said. “Duncan was clear on

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1729">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1751">
				<i class="calibre2">Like a caged animal</i>, Paul thought.

				The Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to
				his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying
				little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and
				balconies and halls…people who saluted and stood aside for him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1834">
				In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul
				asleep on the table with a guard’s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack
				for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and
				onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of
				the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from
				the field, snapped to attention.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1835">
				“At ease,” the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the
				balcony rail.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1836">
				A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight
				overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on
				the southern horizon, the night’s second moon peered through a thin dust
				haze&mdash;an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1837">
				As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs,
				frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a
				chill. He shivered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1838">Anger shot through him.</p>

				To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1842">

				He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that

				running through them, an articulate tread of violet…like giant
				footsteps.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1866">
				Slowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1867">
				“You might just as well mistrust me,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1868">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1876">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1877">“You’re just tired, Father.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1878">
				“I <i class="calibre2">am</i> tired,” the Duke agreed. “I’m morally

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1879">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1880">“Hasn’t it?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1881">
				The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1882">
				“Mother has explained this to me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1883">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1885">
				“My propaganda corps is one of the finest,” the Duke said. Again, he

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1887">“Father!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1888">
				“Yes, I <i class="calibre2">am</i> tired,” the Duke said. “Did you know

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1889">“Sir?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1890">
				“We mustn’t run short of filmbase,” the Duke said. “Else, how could we
				flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how
				well I govern them. How would they know if we didn’t tell them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1891">
				“You should get some rest,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1892">
				Again, the Duke faced his son. “Arrakis has another advantage I almost
				forgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat
				it in almost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural
				immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins’ Handbook.
				And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food
				production&mdash;yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit,
				everything&mdash;under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off
				large segments of our population with poison&mdash;and we cannot be
				attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1893">
				Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: “I have to have
				someone I can say these things to, Son.” He sighed, glanced back at the
				dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now&mdash;trampled by the
				dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1896">
				Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his
				father this despondent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1897">
				“To hold Arrakis,” the Duke said, “one is faced with decisions that may
				cost one his self-respect.” He pointed out the window to the Atreides
				green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the
				landing field. “That honorable banner could come to mean many evil
				things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1898">
				Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His father’s words carried futility, a
				sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1899">
				The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. “Power
				and fear,” he said. “The tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis
				on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there&mdash;they call you
				‘Mahdi’&mdash;‘Lisan al-Gaib’&mdash;as a last resort, you might

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1900">
				Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the
				tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.
			</p>

				The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall

				thought. So much less suitable than a cave.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1913">
				The entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of
				them heavily armed&mdash;slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields.
				Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore
				a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way

				of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding
				rhythm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1914">
				Beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in

				But I am in His Majesty’s service, the Imperial Planetologist.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1933">
				Paul nodded, impressed by the man’s air of strength. Halleck had pointed
				Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building:
				“The man standing there with the Fremen escort&mdash;the one moving now
				toward the ornithopter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1934">
				Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim,
				straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul’s ear:
				“Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking&mdash;clipped off, no
				fuzzy edges&mdash;razor-apt.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1935">
				<span

				>And the Duke, behind them, had said: “Scientist type.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1937">
				Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the
				impact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1938">
				“I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,”
				the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1939">
				“I hope they fit well, my Lord,” Kynes said. “They’re of Fremen make and
				as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1940">
				“I was concerned that you said you couldn’t take us into the desert
				unless we wore these garments,” the Duke said. “We can carry plenty of
				water. We don’t intend to be out long and we’ll have air cover&mdash;the
				escort you see overhead right now. It isn’t likely we’d be forced down.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1941">
				Kynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: “You
				never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1942">
				Halleck stiffened. “The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1943">
				Leto gave Halleck their private hand signal to desist, said: “Our ways
				are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1944">“As you wish, Sire.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1945">
				“We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,” Leto said. “These suits and the
				consideration for our welfare will be remembered.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1946">
				On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said:
				“‘The gift is the blessing of the giver.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1947">
				The words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1948"

					title="176"></span
				>escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building
				leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One
				cried out: “Lisan al-Gaib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1949">
				Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard
				away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around
				the building.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1950">
				“Most interesting,” Leto said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1951">
				Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: “Most of the
				desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them.
				They mean no harm.” But he thought of the words of the legend:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a
					blessing.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1952">
				Leto’s assessment of Kynes&mdash;based partly on Hawat’s brief verbal
				report (guarded and full of suspicions)&mdash;suddenly crystallized: the
				man was Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean
				simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban
				areas&mdash;but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes
				was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner
				guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul’s question had been direct and
				pertinent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1953">Kynes had gone native.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1954">
				“Shouldn’t we be going, Sire?” Halleck asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1955">
				The Duke nodded. “I’ll fly my own ’thopter. Kynes can sit up front with
				me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1956">
				“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, I must
				check the security of your suits.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1957">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-1958"

				>The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my
				own flesh as well as yours…my Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would
				be slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1959">
				The Duke frowned, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this
					could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet…to let him
					inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about
					him?</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1960">
				The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.
				“We’re in your hands,” the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his
				robe, saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert,
				but remaining where he was. “And, if you’d be so kind,” the Duke said,
				“I’d appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so
				intimately with it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1961">
				“Certainly,” Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder
				seals, speaking as he examined the suit. “It’s basically a
				micro-sandwich&mdash;a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.”
				He adjusted the shoulder seals. “The skin-contact layer’s porous.
				Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body…near-normal
				evaporation process. The next two layers…” Kynes tightened the chest
				fit. “…include heat-exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt’s
				reclaimed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1962">
				The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: “Most interesting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1963">“Breathe deeply,” Kynes said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1964">The Duke obeyed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1965">
				Kynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. “Motions
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1966"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="178"></span
				>of the body, especially breathing,” he said, “and some osmotic action
				provide the pumping force.” He loosened the chest fit slightly.
				“Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it
				through this tube in the clip at your neck.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1967">
				The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube.
				“Efficient and convenient,” he said. “Good engineering.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1968">
				Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals. “Urine and feces are processed in
				the thigh pads,” he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a
				sectioned flap there. “In the open desert, you wear this filter across
				your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight
				fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube.
				With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won’t lose more than a
				thimbleful of moisture a day&mdash;even if you’re caught in the Great
				Erg.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1969">
				“A thimbleful a day,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1970">
				Kynes pressed a finger against the suit’s forehead pad, said: “This may
				rub a little. If it irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it
				a bit tighter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1971">
				“My thanks,” the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes
				stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now&mdash;tighter and
				less irritating.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1972">
				Kynes turned to Paul. “Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1973">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>A good man but he’ll have to learn to address us properly</i
				>, the Duke thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1974">
				Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd
				sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his
				foreconsciousness had
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-1975"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="179"></span
				>been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit.
				Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney’s inexpert
				guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the
				chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he
				had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead
				tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1976">
				Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. “You’ve worn
				a stillsuit before?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1977">“This is the first time.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1978">
				“Then someone adjusted it for you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1979">“No.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1980">
				“Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you
				to do that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1981">“It…seemed the right way.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1982">“That it most certainly is.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1983">
				And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“He shall know your ways as though born to them.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1984">
				“We waste time,” the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting ’thopter, led
				the way, accepting the guard’s salute with a nod. He climbed in,
				fastened his safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft
				creaked as the others clambered aboard.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1985">
				Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the
				aircraft&mdash;soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming
				instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as
				doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1986">
				<i class="calibre2">So soft!</i> he thought.
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1990">
				“Southeast over the Shield Wall,” Kynes said. “That’s where I told your

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1991">“Right.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1992">
				The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their
				guard positions as they headed southeast.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1993">
				“The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree
				of sophistication,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1994">
				“Someday I may show you a sietch factory,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1995">
				“I would find that interesting,” the Duke said. “I note that suits are
				manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1996">
				“Inferior copies,” Kynes said. “Any Dune man who values his skin wears a
				Fremen suit.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1997">
				“And it’ll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1998">
				“Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your
				major water loss is through the palms of your hands,” Kynes said. “You
				can wear suit gloves if you’re not using your hands for critical work,
				but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the
				leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-1999">
				The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield
				Wall&mdash;chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by
				black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped
				this ground from space and left it where it smashed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2000">
				They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of
				<span

					id="calibre_link-2001"

					title="181"></span
				>gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The
				sand fingers ran out into the basin&mdash;a dry delta outlined against
				darker rock.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2002">
				Kynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath
				the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet
				stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around
				their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheaths
				and the sheaths appeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange
				combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them
				totally unlike the Harkonnens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2003">
				“When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will
				you say we observed the rules?” Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to
				their course.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2004">
				“The Harkonnens left; you came,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2005">
				“And is everything as it should be?” Leto asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2006">
				Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes’ jaw.
				“As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the
				Imperium…my Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2007">
				The Duke smiled grimly. “But we both know the realities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2008">
				“I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2009">
				“Indeed? And what is your work?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2010">
				In the brief silence, Paul thought:
				<i class="calibre2">He’s pushing this Kynes too hard.</i> Paul glanced
				at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren
				landscape.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2011">
				Kynes spoke stiffly: “You, of course, refer to my duties as
				planetologist.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2012">“Of course.”</p>

				“Do you also investigate the spice?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2016">
				Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man’s cheek. “A
				curious question, my Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2017">
				“Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from
				those of the Harkonnens. I don’t care if you study the spice as long as
				I share what you discover.” He glanced at the planetologist. “The
				Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didn’t they?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2018">
				Kynes stared back without answering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2019">
				“You may speak plainly,” the Duke said, “without fear for your skin.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2020">
				“The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,” Kynes muttered. And he
				thought:

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2021">
				The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. “I detect a
				sour note in your voice, sir. We’ve waded in here with our mob of tame
				killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we’re
				different from the Harkonnens?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2022">
				“I’ve seen the propaganda you’ve flooded into sietch and village,” Kynes

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2023">
				“Here now!” Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2028">
				“Your man Hawat’s subtle,” Kynes said, “but his object’s plain enough.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2029">
				“Will you open those bases to us, then?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2030">
				Kynes spoke curtly: “They’re His Majesty’s property.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2031">“They’re not being used.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2032">“They could be used.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2033">“Does His Majesty concur?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2034">
				Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. “Arrakis could be an Eden if its

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2035">
				<i class="calibre2">He didn’t answer my question</i>, the Duke thought.
				And he said: “How is a planet to become an Eden without money?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2036">
				“What is money,” Kynes asked, “if it won’t buy the services you need?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2037">
				<i class="calibre2">Ah, now!</i> the Duke thought. And he said: “We’ll

				of the Shield Wall. Do I hold the same course?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2038">
				“The same course,” Kynes muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2039">
				Paul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to
				drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a
				knife-edged shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes
				marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull
				smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2041">
				“Are there any plants down there?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2042">
				“Some,” Kynes said. “This latitude’s life-zone has mostly what we call
				minor water stealers&mdash;adapted to raiding each other for moisture,
				gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But
				all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If
				<i class="calibre2">you</i> get caught down there, you imitate that life
				or you die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2043">
				“You mean steal water from each other?” Paul asked. The idea outraged
				him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2044">
				“It’s done,” Kynes said, “but that wasn’t precisely my meaning. You see,
				my climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of
				water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2045">
				And the Duke thought: <i class="calibre2">“…my climate!”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2046">
				“Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,” Kynes said. “There’s
				a blow coming up from the west.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2047">
				The Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked
				the ’thopter around, noting the way the escort’s wings reflected milky
				orange from the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2048">
				“This should clear the storm’s edge,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2049">
				“That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,” Paul said. “Will it
				really cut the strongest metals?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2050">
				“At this altitude, it’s not sand but dust,” Kynes said. “The danger is
				lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.”

				Paul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what
				his mother called “registering” the person. He had Kynes now&mdash;tone
				of voice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the
				left sleeve on the man’s robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The
				waist bulged strangely. It was said that desert men wore a belted sash
				into which they tucked small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from
				such a sash&mdash;certainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper
				pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes’
				robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of
				the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2055">
				Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear

				tuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2068">The planetologist frowned.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2069">
				Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:

				The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2074">
				“It’s merely a bird,” Kynes said, and added: “You have sharp eyes.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2075">
				The panel speaker crackled, then: “Escort Gemma. Object examined under

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2076">
				Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2077">
				“I’d not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2078">
				“That’s likely an eagle,” Kynes said. “Many creatures have adapted to

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2081">
				“Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?” the Duke asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2082">
				Halleck’s music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2083">
				“Not from the deep desert,” Kynes said. “Men have walked out of the
				second zone several times. They’ve survived by crossing the rock areas
				where worms seldom go.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2084">
				The timbre of Kynes’ voice held Paul’s attention. He felt his sense come
				alert the way they were trained to do.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2085">
				“Ah-h, the worms,” the Duke said. “I must see one sometime.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2086">
				“You may see one today,” Kynes said. “Wherever there is spice, there are

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2087">“Always?” Halleck asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2088">“Always.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2089">
				“Is there a relationship between worm and spice?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2090">
				Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. “They defend
				spice <i class="calibre2">sands</i>. Each worm has a&mdash;territory. As
				to the spice…who knows? Worm specimens we’ve examined lead us to suspect
				complicated chemical interchanges within them. We find traces of
				hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere.
				I’ll give you my monograph on the subject.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2091">
				“And a shield’s no defense?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2092">
				“Shields!” Kynes sneered. “Activate a shield within the worm zone and

				>territory lines, come from far around to attack a shield. No man

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2094">“How are worms taken, then?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2095">
				“High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment
				is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm,” Kynes
				said. “They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring
				segment has a life of its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive
				powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They’re incredibly
				tough.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2096">
				“Why hasn’t an effort been made to wipe them out?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2097">
				“Too expensive,” Kynes said. “Too much area to cover.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2098">
				Paul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone
				shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he
				thought:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2099">
				“No one will have to walk out of the desert soon,” the Duke said. “Trip
				these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our
				workers will be wearing them before long. We’re setting up a special
				rescue service.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2100">
				“Very commendable,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2101">
				“Your tone says you don’t agree,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2102">
				“Agree? Of course I agree, but it won’t be much use. Static electricity
				from sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They’ve

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2104">
				“What would you advise?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2105">“You ask my advice?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2106">“As planetologist, yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2107">“You’d follow my advice?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2108">“If I found it sensible.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2109">
				“Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2110">
				The Duke turned his attention from the controls. “That’s all?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2111">
				“That’s all. Never travel alone.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2112">
				“What if you’re separated by a storm and forced down?” Halleck asked.
				“Isn’t there anything you could do?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2113">
				“<i class="calibre2">Anything</i> covers much territory,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2114">
				“What would <i class="calibre2">you</i> do?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2115">
				Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the
				Duke. “I’d remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were
				outside the worm zone or in rock, I’d stay with the ship. If I were down
				in open sand, I’d get away from the ship as fast as I could. About a
				thousand meters would be far enough. Then I’d hide beneath my robe. A
				worm would get the ship, but it might miss me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2116">“Then what?” Halleck asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2117">
				Kynes shrugged. “Wait for the worm to leave.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2118">“That’s all?” Paul asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2119">
				“When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,” Kynes said. “You must
				walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins&mdash;head for the
				nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2120">“Drum sand?” Halleck asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2121">
				<span

				it drumming. Worms always come to that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2123">
				“And a tidal dust basin?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2124">
				“Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the
				centuries. Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will
				swallow the unwary who step into them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2125">
				Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2133">“I see it, Gurney.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2134">
				“That’s what we seek,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2135">
				Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud
				low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2136">
				“One of your factory crawlers,” Kynes said. “It’s on the surface and

				like it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2137">
				“Aircraft over it,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2138">
				“I see two…three…four spotters,” Kynes said. “They’re watching for
				wormsign.”

				>“Wormsign?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2141">
				“A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They’ll have seismic probes on
				the surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.”
				Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. “Should be a carryall wing around,
				but I don’t see it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2142">
				“The worm always comes, eh?” Halleck asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2143">“Always.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2144">
				Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes’ shoulder. “How big an area does each
				worm stake out?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2145">
				Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2146">
				“That depends on the size of the worm.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2147">
				“What’s the variation?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2148">
				“Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small
				ones&mdash;” He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship
				bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated,
				cupped the air. The craft became a full ’thopter as the Duke banked it,
				holding the wings to a gentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to
				the east beyond the factory crawler.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2149">“Is that wormsign?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2150">
				Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2151">
				Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction,
				and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had
				surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of
				them, still some three kilometers away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2152">
				Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples
				toward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching
				into the distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion&mdash;a cresting of
				sand. It reminded

				“Worm,” Kynes said. “Big one.” He leaned back, grabbed the microphone
				from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the
				grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone:
				“Calling crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta
				Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.” He waited.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2155">
				The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: “Who calls
				Delta Ajax niner? Over.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2156">
				“They seem pretty calm about it,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2157">
				Kynes spoke into the microphone: “Unlisted flight&mdash;north and east
				of you about three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your
				position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2158">
				Another voice rumbled from the speaker: “This is Spotter Control.
				Sighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix.” There was a pause, then:
				“Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who’s
				on that unlisted flight? Over.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2159">
				Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2160">“Yes. Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2161">“Who’d be listening?”</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2167">
				“Tell them who had first sight of that worm,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2168">The Duke nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2169">
				Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: “Spotter credit to the Duke
				Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2170">
				The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of
				static: “We read and thank you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2171">
				“Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,” Halleck ordered.
				“Tell them it’s the Duke’s wish.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2172">
				Kynes took a deep breath, then: “It’s the Duke’s wish that you divide
				the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2173">
				“Acknowledged and thank you,” the speaker said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2174">
				The Duke said: “I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in
				public relations.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2175">
				Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2176">
				“This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety,”
				Halleck said. “Word will get around. It was on an area working

				their air cover. “And we’re a pretty strong force. It was a good risk.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2177">
				The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the
				factory crawler. “What happens now?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2178">
				“There’s a carryall wing somewhere close,” Kynes said. “It’ll come in

				close over the crawler, my Lord; you’ll find this interesting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2182">
				The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into
				turbulent air over the crawler.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2183">
				Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic
				monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with
				many wide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted
				funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2184">
				“Rich spice bed by the color,” Kynes said. “They’ll continue working
				until the last minute.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2185">
				The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper
				descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A
				glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling
				overhead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2186">
				Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler’s pipe vents,
				looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.

				“Shouldn’t we be hearing them call in the carryall?” Halleck asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2188">
				“They usually have the wing on a different frequency,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2189">
				“Shouldn’t they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?” the
				Duke asked. “There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there,

				>The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. “This is your
				Duke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner’s crew. All
				spotters are ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We
				will take the west. Over.” He reached down, punched out his own command
				frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the
				microphone back to Kynes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2212">
				Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the
				speaker: “…almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We
				can’t leave that for a damned worm! Over.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2213">
				“Damn the spice!” the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said:
				“We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but
				three of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who’s to go. But
				you’re going, and that’s an order!” He slammed the microphone back into
				Kynes’ hands, muttered: “Sorry,” as Kynes shook an injured finger.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2214">“How much time?” Paul asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2215">“Nine minutes,” Kynes said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2216">
				The Duke said: “This ship has more power than the others. If we took off
				under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional
				man.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2217">
				“That sand’s soft,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2218">
				“With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings,
				Sire,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2219">
				“Not on this ship,” the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the
				’thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the
				’thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.

				Duke opened his door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2222">
				Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of
				cinnamon&mdash;heavy and pungent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2223">
				With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on
				the other side of the crawler. The Duke’s own escort swooped in to land
				in line with him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2224">
				Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the ’thopters were dwarfed
				by it&mdash;gnats beside a warrior beetle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2225">
				“Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,” the Duke said. He
				manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle,
				checked the jet pod controls. “Why the devil aren’t they coming out of
				that machine?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2226">
				“They’re hoping the carryall will show up,” Kynes said. “They still have
				a few minutes.” He glanced off to the east.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2227">
				All turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but
				there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2228">
				The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said:
				“Two of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can
				carry one more man that way. We’re not leaving any men for that
				monster.” He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: “All right,
				you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On
				the double or I’ll cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2229">
				A hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear,
				another at the top. Men came tumbling

				working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and then
				to the sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2231">
				The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step,
				shouted: “Two men each into your spotters.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2232">
				The man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing
				them toward the craft waiting on the other side.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2233">
				“Four over here!” the Duke shouted. “Four into that ship back there!” He
				jabbed a finger at an escort ’thopter directly behind him. The guards
				were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. “And four into that
				ship over there!” He pointed to the other escort that had shed its
				shield generator. “Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2234">
				The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the
				sand followed by three of his companions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2235">
				“I hear the worm, but I can’t see it,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2236">
				The others heard it then&mdash;an abrasive slithering, distant and
				growing louder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2237">
				“Damn sloppy way to operate,” the Duke muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2238">
				Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke
				of a time in his home planet’s jungles, a sudden emergence into a
				clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2239">
				The spice workers slogged up to the side of the ’thopter, started
				climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the
				rear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2240">

				to become sloppy if you didn’t watch such things.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2244">

				his door, checked it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2245">
				“Almost exactly, my Lord,” Kynes said, and he thought:

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2246">
				“All secure here, Sire,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2247">
				The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted
				the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet
				sequence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2248">
				The takeoff pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed
				the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the
				controls&mdash;gently, surely. The ’thopter was fully airborne now, and
				the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2249">
				“She’s very heavy, Sire,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2250">

				really think I’d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2251">
				Halleck grinned, said: “Not a bit of it, Sire.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2252">

				>Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent
				machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred
				meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the
				sand around the factory.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2255">
				“The worm is now beneath the crawler,” Kynes said. “You are about to
				witness a thing few have seen.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2256">
				Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine
				began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming
				there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and
				dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2257">Then they saw it!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2258">
				A wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening
				white spokes within it. The hole’s diameter was at least twice the
				length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid
				into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2259">
				“Gods, what a monster!” muttered a man beside Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2260">
				“Got all our floggin’ spice!” growled another.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2261">
				“Someone is going to pay for this,” the Duke said. “I promise you that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2262">
				By the very flatness of his father’s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger.
				He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2263">
				In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2264">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2265">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2268">
				Paul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully
				at the back of Kynes’ head. One of them whispered: “Liet.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2269">
				Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2270">
				Another of the rescued men began coughing&mdash;dry and rasping.
				Presently, he gasped: “Curse this hell hole!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2271">
				The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: “Be you
				still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.” He stirred among the men until
				he could look through them at the back of the Duke’s head. “You be the
				Duke Leto, I warrant,” he said. “It’s to you we give thanks for our
				lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2272">
				“Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,” Halleck muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2273">
				Paul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the
				corner of his father’s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a
				rage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2274">
				Leto began easing his ’thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped
				at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the
				depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be
				seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide
				over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2275">
				“Who’s that down there?” the Duke barked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2276">
				“Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,” said the tall Dune
				man.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2277">
				“Why wasn’t something said about them?”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2280">
				“My Lord,” said Kynes, “these men know it’s of little use to do anything
				about men trapped on the desert in worm country.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2281">
				“We’ll send a ship from base for them!” the Duke snapped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2282">
				“As you wish, my Lord,” Kynes said. “But likely when the ship gets here
				there’ll be no one to rescue.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2283">
				“We’ll send a ship, anyway,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2284">
				“They were right beside where the worm came up,” Paul said. “How’d they
				escape?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2285">
				“The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,” Kynes
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2286">
				“You waste fuel here, Sire,” Halleck ventured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2287">“Aye, Gurney.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2288">
				The Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort
				came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both
				sides.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2289">
				Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed
				half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the
				surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from
				luring the worm back out of its depths.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2290">
				<i class="calibre2">Fremen!</i> Paul thought.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2296">
				“Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?” the man asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2297">
				“They fit the description,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2298">
				Kynes snorted. “You can’t tell Fremen just by looking at them!” He
				looked at the Dune man. “You. Who were those men?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2299">
				“Friends of one of the others,” the Dune man said. “Just friends from a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2300">Kynes turned away. “Fremen!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2301">
				But he was remembering the words of the legend:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2302">

				should not speak unkindly on them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2303">
				But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had
				brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2304">
				Paul spoke dryly: “A terrible place for them to die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2305">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2306">
				Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2307">
				And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had
				observed here:

				Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2332">
				His face clouded, and he growled: “I’m posting a guard to see that my
				orders are carried out to the letter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2333">
				He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories
				rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He
				remembered open water and waves&mdash;days of grass instead of
				sand&mdash;dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm
				leaves.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2334">All gone.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2335">
				<i class="calibre2">I’m getting old</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman’s
					greed.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2336">
				In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group
				standing in front of the fireplace. An open
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2337"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="208"></span
				>blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and
				laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit
				manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a
				water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a
				representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer
				in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced
				woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as
				cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2338">
				Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific
				type&mdash;decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of
				untouchable sensuousness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2339">
				Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the
				group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm
				colors&mdash;a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an
				earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2340">
				He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his
				recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in
				these shades&mdash;that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2341">
				Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan
				Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling
				black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and
				had his orders from Hawat&mdash;<i class="calibre2"
					>“Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under
					constant surveillance.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2342">
				The Duke glanced around the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2343">
				There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the
				younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2344"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="209"></span
				>among them, three officers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular
				note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul
				was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2345">
				<i class="calibre2">He’ll wear the title well</i>, the Duke thought, and
				realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2346">
				Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around
				at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and
				the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all
				the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were
				cheap masks locked on festering thoughts&mdash;voices gabbling to drown
				out the loud silence in every breast.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2347">
				<i class="calibre2">I’m in a sour mood</i>, he thought, and wondered
				what Gurney would say to that.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2348">
				He knew his mood’s source. He hadn’t wanted to attend this function, but
				his father had been firm. “You have a place&mdash;a position to uphold.
				You’re old enough to do this. You’re almost a man.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2349">
				Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then
				cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2350">
				As Leto approached Jessica’s group, the water-shipper was asking: “Is it
				true the Duke will put in weather control?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2351">
				From behind the man, the Duke said: “We haven’t gone that far in our
				thinking, sir.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2352">
				The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. “Ah-h, the
				Duke,” he said. “We missed you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2353">
				Leto glanced at Jessica. “A thing needed doing.” He
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2354"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="210"></span
				>returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had
				ordered for the laving basins, adding: “As far as I’m concerned, the old
				custom ends now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2355">
				“Is this a ducal order, m’Lord?” the man asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2356">
				“I leave that to your own…ah…conscience,” the Duke said. He turned,
				noting Kynes come up to the group.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2357">
				One of the women said: “I think it’s a very generous
				gesture&mdash;giving water to the&mdash;” Someone shushed her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2358">
				The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an
				old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant
				and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2359">
				The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: “Does the Duke imply
				criticism of our custom?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2360">
				“This custom has been changed,” Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked
				the frown on Jessica’s face, thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>A frown does not become her, but it’ll increase rumors of friction
					between us.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2361">
				“With the Duke’s permission,” the water-shipper said, “I’d like to
				inquire further about customs.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2362">
				Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the man’s voice, noted the watchful
				silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them
				around the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2363">
				“Isn’t it almost time for dinner?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2364">
				“But our guest has some questions,” Leto said. And he looked at the
				water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips,
				recalling Hawat’s memorandum:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“…and this water-shipper is a man to watch&mdash;Lingar Bewt,
					remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled
					him.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2365">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2366"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="211"></span
				>“Water customs are so interesting,” Bewt said, and there was a smile on
				his face. “I’m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached
				to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people’s
				faces…m’Lord?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2367">
				Leto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his
				mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle,
				especially since they now had Bewt’s signature over a contract of
				allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power.
				Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for
				instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal…. The man looked capable of
				such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy
				Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the
				Harkonnens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2368">
				“My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,”
				Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. “We intend to keep it, certainly, but
				only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that
				someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such
				plants anywhere in the open.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2369">
				<i class="calibre2">Bless her!</i> Leto thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Let our water-shipper chew on that.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2370">
				“Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,” the Duke said.
				“I’d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a
				precious commodity on Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2371">
				And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt’s
					organization. And we must start on standby water facilities at once.
					No man is going to hold a club over my head!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2372">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2373"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="212"></span
				>Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face. “A commendable dream, my
				Lord.” He withdrew a pace.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2374">
				Leto’s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes’ face. The man
				was staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured&mdash;like a man in
				love…or caught in a religious trance.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2375">
				Kynes’ thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy:
				<i class="calibre2">“And they shall share your most precious dream.”</i>
				He spoke directly to Jessica: “Do you bring the shortening of the way?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2376">
				“Ah, Dr. Kynes,” the water-shipper said. “You’ve come in from tramping
				around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2377">
				Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: “It is said in the
				desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with
				fatal carelessness.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2378">
				“They have many strange sayings in the desert,” Bewt said, but his voice
				betrayed uneasiness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2379">
				Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment
				in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: “…the shortening of the way.”
				In the old tongue, the phrase translated as “Kwisatz Haderach.” The
				planetologist’s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the
				others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women,
				listening to a low-voiced coquetry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2380">
				<i class="calibre2">Kwisatz Haderach</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too?</i
				>
				The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul.
				<i class="calibre2">He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2381">
				The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the
				water-shipper, and Bewt’s voice lifted
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2382"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="213"></span
				>above the renewed hum of conversations: “Many people have sought to
				change Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2383">
				The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the
				planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2384">
				Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared
				his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served, my Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2385">
				The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2386">
				“The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to
				table,” she said, and smiled: “Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2387">
				He spoke coldly: “That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for
				now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2388">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained</i
				>, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them.
				<i class="calibre2">Who among you believes this lie?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2389">
				Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done
				frequently the past week.
				<i class="calibre2">He acts like a man struggling with himself</i>, she
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet,
					he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men
					with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate
					to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of
					social sharing.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2390">
				Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said
				when informed of the affair:
				<i class="calibre2">“Sire! I forbid it!”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2391">
				A grim smile touched the Duke’s mouth. What a scene that had been. And
				when the Duke had remained
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2392"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="214"></span
				>adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. “I have
				bad feelings about this, my Lord,” he’d said. “Things move too swiftly
				on Arrakis. That’s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2393">
				Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than
				himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the
				young woman said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2394">
				“Her father manufactures stillsuits,” Jessica said. “I’m told that only
				a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man’s
				suits.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2395">
				“Who’s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?” the Duke asked. “I
				don’t place him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2396">
				“A late addition to the list,” she whispered. “Gurney arranged the
				invitation. Smuggler.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2397">“Gurney arranged?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2398">
				“At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was
				a little stiff about it. The smuggler’s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He’s a
				power among his kind. They all know him here. He’s dined at many of the
				houses.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2399">“Why is he here?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2400">
				“Everyone here will ask that question,” she said. “Tuek will sow doubt
				and suspicion just by his presence. He’ll also serve notice that you’re
				prepared to back up your orders against graft&mdash;by enforcement from
				the smugglers’ end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2401">
				“I’m not sure <i class="calibre2">I</i> like it.” He nodded to a passing
				couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. “Why
				didn’t you invite some Fremen?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2402">“There’s Kynes,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2403">
				“Yes, there’s Kynes,” he said. “Have you arranged any
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2404"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="215"></span
				>other little surprises for me?” He led her into step behind the
				procession.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2405">
				“All else is most conventional,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2406">
				And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>My darling, can’t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships,
					that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from
					Arrakis if all else fails us here.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2407">
				As they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed
				Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his
				chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping
				of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and
				the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back,
				standing at attention.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2408">
				Uneasy silence settled over the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2409">
				Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at
				the corners of Leto’s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his
				cheeks. <i class="calibre2">What has angered him?</i> she asked herself.
				<i class="calibre2">Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2410">
				“Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,” Leto said. “This
				is my way of telling you that many things will change.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2411">
				Embarrassed silence settled over the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2412">
				<i class="calibre2">They think him drunk</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2413">
				Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights
				shot beams of reflection off it. “As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,”
				he said, “I give you a toast.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2414">
				The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the
				sudden stillness, a suspensor light
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2415"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="216"></span
				>drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway.
				Shadows played across the Duke’s hawk features.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2416">
				“Here I am and here I remain!” he barked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2417">
				There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths&mdash;stopped as
				the Duke remained with arm upraised. “My toast is one of those maxims so
				dear to our hearts: ‘Business makes progress! Fortune passes
				everywhere!’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2418">He sipped his water.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2419">
				The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2420">“Gurney!” the Duke called.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2421">
				From an alcove at Leto’s end of the room came Halleck’s voice. “Here, my
				Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2422">“Give us a tune, Gurney.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2423">
				A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began
				putting plates of food on the table at the Duke’s gesture releasing
				them&mdash;roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka
				under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice
				wafted across the table), a true pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan
				wine.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2424">
				Still, the Duke remained standing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2425">
				As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed
				before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: “In olden times, it was
				the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.” His
				knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. “I
				cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurney’s song.
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2426"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="217"></span
				>Consider it another toast&mdash;a toast to all who’ve died bringing us
				to this station.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2427">
				An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2428">
				Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest
				her&mdash;there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the
				pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle-faced
				scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek,
				his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2429">
				“Review, friends&mdash;troops long past review,” the Duke intoned. “All
				to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver
				collars. Review, friends&mdash;troops long past review: Each a dot of
				time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune.
				Review, friends&mdash;troops long past review. When our time ends on its
				rictus smile, we’ll pass the lure of fortune.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2430">
				The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep
				drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water
				slopped over the brim onto the linen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2431">
				The others drank in embarrassed silence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2432">
				Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its
				remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table
				must do the same.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2433">
				Jessica was first to follow his example.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2434">
				There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their
				flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the
				reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her
				guests’ actions revealed&mdash;especially among the women. This was
				clean,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2435"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="218"></span
				>potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel.
				Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed
				reactions, nervous laughter…and violent obedience to the necessity. One
				woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion
				recovered it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2436">
				Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetologist
				hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket.
				He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty
				flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by
				his action.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2437">
				Halleck’s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its
				minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the
				mood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2438">
				“Let the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2439">
				<i class="calibre2">He’s angry and uncertain</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should
					have. It must be something more than that loss. He acts like a
					desperate man.</i
				>
				She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2440">
				Slowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under
				way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and
				wine.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2441">
				“We brought both from Caladan,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2442">
				“Superb!” he said, tasting the chukka. “Simply superb! And not a hint of
				melange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2443">
				The Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes.

				>“I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost
				to a worm.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2445">
				“News travels fast,” the Duke said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2446">
				“Then it’s true?” the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2447">
				“Of course, it’s true!” the Duke snapped. “The blasted carryall
				disappeared. It shouldn’t be possible for anything that big to
				disappear!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2448">
				“When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,” Kynes
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2449">
				“It should <i class="calibre2">not</i> be possible!” the Duke repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2450">
				“No one saw the carryall leave?” the banker asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2451">
				“Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,” Kynes said. “They’re
				primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall’s complement usually is
				four men&mdash;two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one&mdash;or
				even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke’s foes&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2452">
				“Ah-h-h, I see,” the banker said. “And you, as Judge of the Change, do
				you challenge this?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2453">
				“I shall have to consider my position carefully,” Kynes said, “and I
				certainly will not discuss it at table.” And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this is the kind of infraction
					I was instructed to ignore.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2454">
				The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2455">
				Jessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days.
				The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump,
				happy-faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice
				contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2456">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>A thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school
					is the similar basic reaction pattern of all
					<span

					>its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2458">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2459">
				Now, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests,
				hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of
				realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime
				speech pattern&mdash;subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness
				as though he had announced himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2460">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Does this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House
					Atreides?</i
				>
				she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion
				by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray
				his purpose.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent,
					but with ominous overtones,</i
				>
				she told herself. <i class="calibre2">It’s his pattern.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2461">
				The banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to
				him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man
				down the table
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2462"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="221"></span
				>who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no
				thorns.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2463">
				“I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,” the banker said,
				directing his words at Jessica. “All of our birds, of course, are
				carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become
				blood-drinkers.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2464">
				The stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, seated between Paul and his
				father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a
				frown, said: “Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2465">
				The banker smiled. “They call me Soo-Soo because I’m financial adviser
				to the Water Peddlers Union.” And, as Jessica continued to look at him
				without comment, he added: “Because of the water-sellers’
				cry&mdash;‘Soo-Soo Sook!’” And he imitated the call with such accuracy
				that many around the table laughed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2466">
				Jessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young
				woman had spoken on cue&mdash;a set piece. She had produced the excuse
				for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The
				water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to
				Jessica that the banker had said:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“I, too, control that ultimate source of power on
					Arrakis&mdash;water.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2467">
				Paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion’s voice, saw that
				his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity.
				On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He
				addressed himself to the banker.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2468">
				“Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2469">
				“That’s an odd question, young Master,” the banker
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2470"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="222"></span
				>said. “I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn’t have to be the
				blood of their own kind, does it?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2471">
				“It was <i class="calibre2">not</i> an odd question,” Paul said, and
				Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his
				voice. “Most educated people know that the worst potential competition
				for any young organism can come from its own kind.” He deliberately
				forked a bite of food from his companion’s plate, ate it. “They are
				eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2472">
				The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2473">
				“Do not make the error of considering my son a child,” the Duke said.
				And he smiled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2474">
				Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that
				both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2475">
				“It’s a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the young Master appears to
				understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the
				struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood’s an efficient energy
				source.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2476">
				The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: “It’s said that
				the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2477">
				Kynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: “Not the blood, sir.
				But all of a man’s water, ultimately, belongs to his people&mdash;to his
				tribe. It’s a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s
				precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent
				water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2478">
				The banker put both hands against the table beside his
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2479"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="223"></span
				>plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in
				a rage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2480">
				Kynes looked at Jessica. “Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such
				an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it
				needed clarifying.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2481">
				“You’ve associated so long with Fremen that you’ve lost all
				sensibilities,” the banker rasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2482">
				Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. “Are you
				challenging me, sir?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2483">
				The banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: “Of course not. I’d not
				so insult our host and hostess.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2484">
				Jessica heard the fear in the man’s voice, saw it in his face, in his
				breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified
				of Kynes!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2485">
				“Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when
				they’ve been insulted,” Kynes said. “They’re brave people who understand
				defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that
				they are here…now…on Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2486">
				Jessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not.
				People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight
				under the table. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly
				smiling at the banker’s discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who
				appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was
				looking at Kynes in admiration.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2487">“Well?” Kynes said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2488">
				“I meant no offense,” the banker muttered. “If offense was taken, please
				accept my apologies.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2489">
				“Freely given, freely accepted,” Kynes said. He smiled at
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2490"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="224"></span
				>Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2491">
				Jessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the
				man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes’
				assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2492">
				Leto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The ecologist’s
				manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides.
				Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2493">
				Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared
				with <i class="calibre2">langues de lapins de garenne</i>&mdash;red wine
				and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2494">
				Slowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation
				in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence.
				<i class="calibre2">Kynes would have killed him without hesitating</i>,
				she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward
				killing in Kynes’ manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that
				this was a Fremen quality.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2495">
				Jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: “I find
				myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2496">
				“Very important,” he agreed. “What is this dish? It’s delicious.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2497">
				“Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,” she said. “A very old
				recipe.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2498">
				“I must have that recipe,” the man said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2499">
				She nodded. “I’ll see that you get it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2500">
				Kynes looked at Jessica, said: “The newcomer to Arrakis
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2501"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="225"></span
				>frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are
				dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2502">
				She heard the testing quality in his voice, said, “Growth is limited by
				that necessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the
				least favorable condition controls the growth rate.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2503">
				“It’s rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological
				problems,” Kynes said. “Water is the least favorable condition for life
				on Arrakis. And remember that <i class="calibre2">growth</i> itself can
				produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2504">
				Jessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes’ words, but knew she was
				missing it. “Growth,” she said. “Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly
				cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2505">
				“Impossible!” the water magnate barked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2506">
				Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. “Impossible?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2507">
				“Impossible on Arrakis,” he said. “Don’t listen to this dreamer. All the
				laboratory evidence is against him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2508">
				Kynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations
				around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new
				interchange.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2509">
				“Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,” Kynes
				said. “That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that
				originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on
				their normal existence.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2510">
				“Normal!” Bewt snorted. “Nothing about Arrakis is normal!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2511">
				“Quite the contrary,” Kynes said. “Certain harmonies
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2512"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="226"></span
				>could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to
				understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2513">
				“It’ll never be done,” Bewt said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2514">
				The Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes’
				attitude had changed&mdash;it had been when Jessica had spoken of
				holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2515">
				“What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?”
				Leto asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2516">
				“If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis
				involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we’ve started the
				cyclic system,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2517">
				“Water’s the only problem?” the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes’ excitement,
				felt himself caught up in it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2518">
				“Water overshadows the other problems,” Kynes said. “This planet has
				much oxygen without its usual concomitants&mdash;widespread plant life
				and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as
				volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface
				areas here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2519">
				“Do you have pilot projects?” the Duke asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2520">
				“We’ve had a long time in which to build up the Tansley
				Effect&mdash;small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my
				science may now draw its working facts,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2521">
				“There isn’t enough water,” Bewt said. “There just isn’t enough water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2522">
				“Master Bewt is an expert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back
				to his dinner.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2523">
				<span

				>The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: “No! I want

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2525">Kynes stared at his plate.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2526">
				Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face.
				<i class="calibre2">He masks himself well</i>, she thought, but she had
				him registered now and read that he regretted his words.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2527">
				“Is there enough water!” the Duke demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2528">“There…may be,” Kynes said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2529">
				<i class="calibre2">He’s faking uncertainty!</i> Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2530">
				With his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to
				use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2531">
				“Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,” Bewt said. “He dreams
				with the Fremen&mdash;of prophecies and messiahs.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2532">
				Chuckles sounded at odd places around the table. Jessica marked
				them&mdash;the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter, Duncan
				Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2533">
				<i class="calibre2">Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight</i>,
				Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2534">
				The Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly
				let down, as though something vital had passed him here.
				<i class="calibre2">“May</i>be,<i class="calibre2">”</i> he muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2535">
				Kynes spoke quickly: “Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my
				Lord. There are so many&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2536">
				The planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in
				through the service door, was passed
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2537"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="228"></span
				>by the guard and rushed to the Duke’s side. The man bent, whispering
				into Leto’s ear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2538">
				Jessica recognized the capsign of Hawat’s corps, fought down uneasiness.
				She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer’s feminine
				companion&mdash;a tiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of
				epicanthic fold to the eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2539">
				“You’ve hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” Jessica said. “May I order
				you something?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2540">
				The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then:
				“I’m not very hungry.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2541">
				Abruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of
				command: “Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a
				matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.” He stepped
				aside. “Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2542">
				Paul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had
				to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father’s
				chair, sat down in it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2543">
				The Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: “Gurney, please
				take Paul’s place at table. We mustn’t have an odd number here. When the
				dinner’s over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for
				my call.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2544">
				Halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness
				seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset
				against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2545">
				“There’s no need for alarm,” the Duke said, “but I must ask that no one
				leave until our house guard says it’s
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2546"

				>safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and
				we’ll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2547">
				Paul caught the code words in his father’s message&mdash;<i
					class="calibre2"
					>guard-safe-secure-shortly</i
				>. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had
				read the same message. They both relaxed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2548">
				The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door
				followed by his trooper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2549">
				Paul said: “Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was
				discussing water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2550">
				“May we discuss it another time?” Kynes asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2551">“By all means,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2552">
				And Jessica noted with pride her son’s dignity, the mature sense of
				assurance.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2553">
				The banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. “None
				of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might
				almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead
				us in a toast. Perhaps you’ve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be
				treated like a man.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2554">
				Jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a
				hand signal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2556">
				Paul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards,
				looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said:
				“Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered.
				He&mdash;”

				>“Drowned?” It was the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2559">
				Paul hesitated, then: “Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2560">
				“What an interesting way to die,” she murmured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2561">
				Paul’s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker.
				“The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his
				shoulders&mdash;made by another fisherman’s claw-boots. This fisherman
				was one of several in a boat&mdash;a craft for traveling on
				water&mdash;that foundered…sank beneath the water. Another fisherman
				helping recover the body said he’d seen marks like this man’s wounds
				several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand
				on this poor fellow’s shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the
				surface&mdash;to reach air.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2562">
				“Why is this interesting?” the banker asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2563">
				“Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the
				drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is
				understandable&mdash;except when you see it happen in the drawing room.”
				Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming,
				then: “And, I should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2564">
				A sudden stillness enfolded the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2565">
				<i class="calibre2">That was rash</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>This banker might have enough rank to call my son out.</i

				She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The house troopers
				were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2566">
				“Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!” It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2569">Bewt was grinning.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2570">
				The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2571">
				Kynes said: “One baits an Atreides at his own risk.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2572">
				“Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?” the banker demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2573">
				Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: “Sir!” And she
				thought:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2574">
				“My son displays a general garment and you claim it’s cut to your fit?”
				Jessica asked. “What a fascinating revelation.” She slid a hand down to
				her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2575">
				The banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and
				she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for
				action. He had focused on the code word:
				<i class="calibre2">garment. “Prepare for violence.”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2576">
				Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal
				to Tuek.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2577">
				The smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. “I’ll give you a
				toast,” he said. “To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but
				a man by his actions.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2578">
				<i class="calibre2">Why do they intrude?</i> Jessica asked herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2579">
				The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2580">
				People began responding all around the table.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2581">

				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"

				Only Paul and the banker&mdash;(<i class="calibre2"
					>Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname!</i

				Jessica thought.)&mdash;remained empty-handed. The banker’s attention
				stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2585">
				<i class="calibre2">I was handling it correctly</i>, Paul thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Why do they interfere?</i> He glanced covertly at
				the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly
				not from that banker fellow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2586">
				Halleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his
				words over the heads of the guests across from him: “In our society,
				people shouldn’t be quick to take offense. It’s frequently suicidal.” He
				looked at the stillsuit manufacturer’s daughter beside him. “Don’t you
				think so, miss?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2587">
				“Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do,” she said. “There’s too much violence. It
				makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die
				anyway. It doesn’t make sense.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2588">
				“Indeed it doesn’t,” Halleck said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2589">
				Jessica saw the near perfection of the girl’s act, realized:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little
					female.</i
				>
				She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too,
				had detected it. They had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica
				relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it&mdash;his
				training hadn’t overlooked that obvious gambit.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2590">
				Kynes spoke to the banker: “Isn’t another apology in order?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2591">
				<span

				I’ve overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and
				I’m not accustomed to it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2593">
				Jessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: “When strangers
				meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and
				training.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2594">
				“Thank you, my Lady,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2595">
				The dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward
				Jessica, said: “The Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that
				doesn’t mean more fighting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2596">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>She was directed to lead the conversation this way</i
				>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2597">
				“Likely this will prove unimportant,” Jessica said. “But there’s so much
				detail requiring the Duke’s personal attention in these times. As long
				as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too
				careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent
				alive on Arrakis, of course.” She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. “And
				the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.” She shifted her
				attention to Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2598">“Indeed it is,” Kynes said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2599">
				The stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked
				at him, said: “I do believe I’ll eat something now. I’d like some of
				that bird dish you served earlier.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2600">
				Jessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were
				speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-2601"
					role="doc-pagebreak"

				>find so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the
				spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2602">
				“Oh, no, my Lady,” he said. “Very little’s known of the deep desert. And
				almost nothing of the southern regions.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2603">
				“There’s a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the
				southern reaches,” Kynes said, “but I suspect it was an imaginative
				invention made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters
				do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that’s
				extremely dangerous&mdash;navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent.
				Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield
				Wall bases. It hasn’t been found profitable to venture too far south.
				Perhaps if we had a weather satellite….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2604">
				Bewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: “It’s said the Fremen
				travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and
				sip-wells even in the southern latitudes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2605">
				“Soaks and sip-wells?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2606">
				Kynes spoke quickly: “Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other
				planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the
				surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according
				to certain signs. A sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws
				water through a straw…so it is said.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2607">
				<i class="calibre2">There’s deception in his words</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2608">
				<i class="calibre2">Why is he lying?</i> Paul wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2609">
				“How very interesting,” Jessica said. And she thought:

				>“<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2611">
				“I’ve heard you have a saying,” Paul said, “that polish comes from the
				cities, wisdom from the desert.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2612">
				“There are many sayings on Arrakis,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2613">
				Before Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with
				a note. She opened it, saw the Duke’s handwriting and code signs,
				scanned it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2614">
				“You’ll all be delighted to know,” she said, “that our Duke sends his
				reassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The
				missing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew
				overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers’ base, hoping
				to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.”
				She nodded to Tuek.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2615">The smuggler nodded back.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2616">
				Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2617">
				“I’m glad it didn’t come to open battle,” the banker said. “The people
				have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2618">
				“Especially prosperity,” Bewt said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2619">
				“Shall we have our dessert now?” Jessica asked. “I’ve had our chef
				prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2620">
				“It sounds wonderful,” the stillsuit manufacturer said. “Would it be
				possible to get the recipe?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2621">
				“Any recipe you desire,” Jessica said,
				<i class="calibre2">registering</i> the man for later mention to Hawat.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2624">
				Jessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto’s
				message:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured
					them. This may mean they’ve succeeded with other shipments. It

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2625">
				Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of
				disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that
				substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would
				explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A
				lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful
				than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2626">
				The unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2627">
				Paul said: “I never doubted we’d find the carryall. Once my father moves
				to solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are
				beginning to discover.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2628">
				<i class="calibre2">He’s boasting</i>, Jessica thought.

				She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2639">

				To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding

				One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: “You see what you

				The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2680">
				“We can’t argue with him all night,” Jessica said. And she thought:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2681">
				“There’s no reason for you to stay, my Lady,” Yueh said. “I can take

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2682">
				Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply
				across the cheek.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2683">
				He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2684">
				“This is no way to act in your Duke’s home,” she said. She snatched the
				cup from Yueh’s hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho.
				“Now drink this! That’s an order!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2685">
				Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2686">
				Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2687">
				Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to
				her&mdash;the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions
				around her these past few days could now be translated. She found
				herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain. It took the
				most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to quiet her pulse and
				smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.

				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2698">
				Jessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2699">
				The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: “Perhaps we should

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2700">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2701">The guard swallowed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2702">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2712">
				“You’re sure you’ll not need me?”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2715">
				“You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2716">
				Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her

				strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the
				shield-blanked windows of her sitting room.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2717">
				Jessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered
				cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door.
				She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her
				leg. She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop
				of it. Once more, she glanced around the room, placing everything
				precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner,
				the straight chairs along the wall, the two low tables, her
				stand-mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2718">
				Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat
				down in the armchair, patting the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2720">
				<i class="calibre2">Now, let him come</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">We shall see what we shall see.</i> And she prepared

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2721">
				Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat
				entered at her command.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2722">
				She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling
				sense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue
				beneath. Hawat’s rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared
				faintly yellow in the room’s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on
				the sleeve of his knife arm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2723">She smelled blood there.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2724">
				Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: “Bring that
				chair and sit facing me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2725">
				Hawat bowed, obeyed.
				<i class="calibre2">That drunken fool of an Idaho!</i> he thought. He
				studied Jessica’s face, wondering how he could save this situation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2726">
				“It’s long past time to clear the air between us,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2727">
				“What troubles my Lady?” He sat down, placed hands on knees.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2728">
				“Don’t play coy with me!” she snapped. “If Yueh didn’t tell you why I
				summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2729">“As you wish, my Lady.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2730">
				“First, you will answer me one question,” she said. “Are you now a

				“Sit down,” she said. “You insulted me so.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2734">
				Slowly, he sank back into the chair.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2735">
				And Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2736">
				“Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke,” she said. “I’m prepared,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2737">
				“Is there something to forgive?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2738">
				Jessica scowled, wondering:
				<i class="calibre2"

				“As you say. We’ve no Truthsayer.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2741">
				“Is there a traitor among us?” she asked. “I’ve studied our people with

				“Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the

				“What brought this base suspicion on me?” she asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2749">
				Hawat frowned. “My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2750">
				“I’m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,” she said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2752">“Stalemate?” she asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2753">He shrugged.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2754">
				“Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,” she said. “Duncan
				Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2755">
				“You have your reports, my Lady.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2756">
				“So I do. Don’t you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2757">“My Lady speaks riddles.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2758">
				“Apply your Mentat abilities to it!” she snapped. “What’s the problem

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2759">
				He jabbed a finger at the floor. “Arrakis, that’s their home.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2760">
				“Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we’ve uprooted them.
				They have no home. And they fear the Duke’s failing them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2761">
				He stiffened. “Such talk from one of the men would be cause for&mdash;”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2765">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2770">
				“A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,” she said.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2771">
				His face darkened. “I offered my resignation to the Duke.”

				“Did you offer your resignation to me…or to Paul?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2773">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2774">
				“I’m the Duke’s man,” he said, biting off the words.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2775">
				“There is no traitor,” she said. “The threat’s something else. Perhaps

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2776">
				“And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn’t atomic?” he
				asked. “No, my Lady. They’ll not risk anything

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2778">
				“You’re the Duke’s man,” she sneered. “Would you destroy him in the
				effort to save him?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2779">
				He took a deep breath, then: “If you’re innocent, you’ll have my most
				abject apologies.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2780">
				“Look at you now, Thufir,” she said. “Humans live best when each has his
				own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things.
				Destroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all
				those who love the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the

				Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2781">
				“You threaten me?” he growled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2782">
				“Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2783">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2787">
				“Then you question my abilities?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2788">
				She sighed. “Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2790">
				“You think now to teach me my trade?” he asked, and he did not try to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2791">
				“Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to
				it,” she said. “But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal
				problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to
				bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming
				everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on
				us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2792">
				“You’re deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as
				a Mentat,” he rasped. “Were I to find one of our people attempting thus

				denounce and destroy him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2793">
				“The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2795">
				“Then apply yourself to these symptoms we’ve both seen: drunkenness

				his command post.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2872">
				The note read: “A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2878">
				On top of all the military problems, there’d been the disquieting

				The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through
				the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2883">
				At the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A
				strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put
				his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into
				his right hand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange
				sound had sent a chill through him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2884">
				Softly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate
				illumination. The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight
				meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone
				walls swallowed the light.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2885">
				A dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2886">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2888">
				Silently, he moved toward the gray blob, saw that it was a human figure,
				a man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife
				poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face. It was the
				smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest. The dead eyes stared with
				empty darkness. Leto touched the stain&mdash;warm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2889">
				<i class="calibre2">How could this man be dead here?</i> Leto asked
				himself. <i class="calibre2">Who killed him?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2890">
				The mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side
				passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield
				generator for the house.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2891">
				Hand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped
				down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2892">
				Another gray blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he
				saw at once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward
				him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2893">
				Leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage,
				crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen
				housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A
				dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side. He
				touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped
				up to peer at him, the eyes black-shadowed emptiness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2894">
				“S’you,” she gasped.
				“Killed…guard…sent…get…Tuek…escape…m’Lady…you…you…here…no….” She flopped

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2897">
				He started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand
				toward the shield switch&mdash;too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm
				aside. He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed
				paralysis spreading from it up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to
				lift his head and look down the passage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2898">
				Yueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected
				yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door.
				There was stillness from the room behind him&mdash;no sound of
				generators.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2899">
				<i class="calibre2">Yueh!</i> Leto thought.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2900">
				Yueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2901">
				Leto found he could still speak, gasped: “Yueh! How?” Then the paralysis
				reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against
				the stone wall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2902">
				Yueh’s face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto’s
				forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was
				remote…dull.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2903">
				“The drug on the dart is selective,” Yueh said. “You can speak, but I’d
				advise against it.” He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto,
				pulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering
				on the stones was faint and distant to the Duke’s ears.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2904">
				<i class="calibre2">It can’t be Yueh,</i> Leto thought.
				<i class="calibre2">He’s conditioned.</i>

				“I’m sorry, my dear Duke, but there <i class="calibre2">are</i> things

				actually wish it. I will stop at nothing to do it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2908">
				He looked down at the Duke. “Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron
				Harkonnen. I wish to kill the Baron.”

				“Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven’t much time. That peg tooth I
				put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal&mdash;that tooth must be
				replaced. In a moment, I’ll render you unconscious and replace that
				tooth.” He opened his hand, stared at something in it. “An exact
				duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve. It’ll escape
				the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you bite down hard on
				it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath sharply, you
				fill the air around you with a poison gas&mdash;most deadly.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2911">
				Leto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man’s eyes, the
				perspiration along brow and chin.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2912">
				“You were dead anyway, my poor Duke,” Yueh said. “But you will get close

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2915">“The tooth,” Yueh muttered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2916">“Why?” Leto whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2917">
				Yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. “I made a shaitan’s
				bargain with the Baron. And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half
				of it. When I see him, I’ll know. When I look at the Baron, then I
				<i class="calibre2">will</i> know. But I’ll never enter his presence
				without the price. You’re the price, my poor Duke. And I’ll know when I

				when I see the Baron&mdash;then, I <i class="calibre2">will</i> know.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2918">
				Leto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh’s hand. He felt this was
				happening in a nightmare&mdash;it could not be.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2919">
				Yueh’s purple lips turned up in a grimace. “I’ll not get close enough to

				distance. But you…ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He’ll want you close
				to him&mdash;to gloat over you, to boast a little.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2920">
				Leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of
				Yueh’s jaw. The muscle twisted when the man spoke.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2921">
				Yueh leaned closer. “And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must

				“How…save…them?” Leto whispered.

				The Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw

				Cool remoteness spread upward from Leto’s jaw, across his cheeks. The

				it.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2939">
				She began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles,

				<i class="calibre2">They’ve taken me someplace else.</i>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2964">She opened her eyes.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2965">
				The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized
				the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one

				near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond
				that hurt her eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2966">
				She looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his
				portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath
				spider-black eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2967">
				“The drug was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d be

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2969">
				“Such a pity you must remain gagged,” the Baron said. “We could have
				such an interesting conversation.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2970">
				<i class="calibre2">Yueh’s the only one it could be,</i> she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">How?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2971">
				The Baron glanced behind him at the door. “Come in, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2972">
				She had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron,
				but the face was known&mdash;and the man:
				<i class="calibre2">Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin.</i> She studied

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2974">
				“Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica,” the
				Baron said. “However, I’m aware of your abilities.” He glanced at the
				Mentat. “Isn’t that true, Piter?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2975">
				“As you say, Baron,” the man said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2976">
				The voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She
				had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit
				training, the voice screamed: <i class="calibre2">Killer!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2977">
				“I have a surprise for Piter,” the Baron said. “He thinks he has come
				here to collect his reward&mdash;you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to
				demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2978">
				“You play with me, Baron?” Piter asked, and he smiled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2979">
				Seeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to
				defend himself from this Piter. Then she corrected herself. The Baron
				could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2980">
				“In many ways, Piter is quite naive,” the Baron said. “He doesn’t admit
				to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I’d show him,
				but it’d be a foolish risk.” The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had
				become a waiting mask. “I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants
				power.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2981">
				“You promised I could have <i class="calibre2">her</i>,” Piter said. The

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2984">
				“I give you a choice, Piter,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2985">“What choice?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2986">
				The Baron snapped fat fingers. “This woman and exile from the Imperium,
				or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2987">
				Jessica watched the Baron’s spider eyes study Piter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2988">
				“You could be Duke here in all but name,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2989">
				<i class="calibre2">Is my Leto dead, then?</i> Jessica asked herself.
				She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2990">
				The Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. “Understand yourself, Piter.
				You want her because she was a Duke’s woman, a symbol of his
				power&mdash;beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an
				entire duchy, Piter! That’s more than a symbol; that’s the reality. With
				it you could have many women…and more.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2991">“You do not joke with Piter?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2992">
				The Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him.
				“Joke? I? Remember&mdash;<i class="calibre2">I</i> am giving up the boy.
				You heard what the traitor said about the lad’s training. They are
				alike, this mother and son&mdash;deadly.” The Baron smiled. “I must go
				now. I will send in the guard I’ve reserved for this moment. He’s stone
				deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey
				into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of
				you. He’ll not permit you to untie her gag until you’re off Arrakis. If
				you choose not to leave…he has other orders.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2995">
				“Ah, hah!” the Baron chortled. “Such quick decision can mean only one
				thing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2996">
				“I will take the duchy,” Piter said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2997">
				And Jessica thought:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2998">
				The Baron glanced down at Jessica. “Is it not wonderful that I know
				Piter so well? I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be
				Piter’s choice. Hah! Well, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much
				better. You understand, Lady Jessica? I had no rancor toward you. It’s a
				necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And I’ve not
				<i class="calibre2">actually</i> ordered you destroyed. When it’s asked
				of me what happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-2999">
				“You leave it to me then?” Piter asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3000">
				“The guard I send you will take your orders,” the Baron said.
				“Whatever’s done I leave to you.” He stared at Piter. “Yes. There will
				be no blood on my hands here. It’s your decision. Yes. I know nothing of
				it. You will wait until I’ve gone before doing whatever you must do.
				Yes. Well…ah, yes. Yes. Good.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3002">
				With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3006">
				Scarface looked at Piter. “We’ve the boy on a litter outside. What are
				your orders?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3007">
				Piter spoke to Jessica. “I’d thought of binding you by a threat held
				over your son, but I begin to see that would not have worked. I let
				emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” He looked at the first
				pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: “Take
				them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a
				good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never
				be found.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3008">
				“You don’t wish to dispatch them yourself?” Scarface asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3009">
				<i class="calibre2">He reads lips,</i> Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3010">
				“I follow my Baron’s example,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3011">
				Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thought:
				<i class="calibre2">He, too, fears the Truthsayer.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3012">
				Piter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated
				there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her,
				but he went out without turning.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3013">
				“Me, I wouldn’t like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this
				night’s work,” Scarface said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3014">
				“You ain’t likely ever to run into that old witch,” one
				<span

				her. “It ain’t getting our work done standing around here chattering.
				Take her feet and&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3016">
				“Why’n’t we kill ’em here?” Scarface asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3017">
				“Too messy,” the first one said. “Unless you wants to strangle ’em. Me,
				I likes a nice straightforward job. Drop ’em on the desert like that

				Nothing to clean up afterwards.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3018">
				“Yeah…well, I guess you’re right,” Scarface said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3019">
				Jessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her
				Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3020">
				Scarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a
				sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a
				suspensor-buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her,
				fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion’s face&mdash;Paul! He
				was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters
				from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3021">
				<i class="calibre2">Is he drugged?</i> she wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3022">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3025">
				He had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind,
				listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul
				contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother
				had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3028">
				He wondered who could’ve captured her. His own captivity was plain
				enough&mdash;to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find
				himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her.
				Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance.
				There was no understanding it&mdash;a Suk doctor a traitor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3029">
				The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it
				through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against
				the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A ’thopter wing
				loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3030">
				Paul’s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper
				as the man who opened the ’thopter door, peered inside at the green
				gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3031">
				“This the ’thopter we’re supposed to use?” he asked, and turned to watch

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3032">
				“It’s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,” the other
				said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3033">
				Scarface nodded. “But&mdash;it’s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain’t

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3034">
				“Two’s enough,” said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3035">
				“The Baron, he told me to make sure what happened to them two,” Scarface

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3039">
				“Ah-h-h….” The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. “One
				of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3040">
				The trooper behind him grunted. “She’ll be worm meat soon enough. Don’t

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3041">
				“Yee-up,” the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3042">
				“It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,” Scarface said.

				Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The ’thopter took off in a

				almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3055">
				“Real pretty, she is,” Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue.
				“Sure do seem a shame.” He looked at Czigo.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3056">
				“You thinking what I think you’re thinking?” the pilot asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3057">

				The ’thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and
				Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3065">
				“This oughta be far enough,” the pilot said. “The traitor said to put
				’em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.” He dipped the craft
				toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over
				the desert surface.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3066">
				Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3067">
				The ’thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3068">

				“Remove her gag,” Paul commanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3077">
				Jessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre

				have been better, but it could still fall within this man’s spectrum.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3078">
				Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica’s mouth, slipped

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3080">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3081">
				Kinet put a hand on the pilot’s arm. “Look, Czigo, no need to….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3082">
				Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in
				low, intimate tones. “Gentlemen! No need to
				<i class="calibre2">fight</i> over me.” At the same time, she writhed
				sinuously for Kinet’s benefit.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3083">
				She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were
				convinced of the need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no

				over her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3084">
				She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would
				read her lips, said: “You mustn’t disagree.” They drew farther apart,
				glanced warily at each other. “Is any woman worth fighting over?” she
				asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3085">
				By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth

				“Yeah,” Scarface said. “No need to fight over….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3089">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3090">
				Scarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3091">
				“Thought I was some dummy didn’t know that trick,” Czigo said. He
				brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected
				moonlight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3092">
				“Now for the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3093">
				“No need for that,” Jessica murmured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3094">Czigo hesitated.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3095">
				“Wouldn’t you rather have me cooperative?” Jessica asked. “Give the boy
				a chance.” Her lip curled in a sneer. “Little enough chance he’d have
				out there in that sand. Give him that and….” She smiled. “You could find
				yourself well rewarded.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3096">
				Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. “I’ve
				heard me what can happen to a man in this desert,” he said. “Boy might
				find the knife a kindness.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3097">
				“Is it so much I ask?” Jessica pleaded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3098">
				“You’re trying to trick me,” Czigo muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3099">
				“I don’t want to see my son die,” Jessica said. “Is that a trick?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3100">
				Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him
				across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed.
				“What’ll y’ do, cub, if I cut y’r bonds?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3101">
				<span

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3103">
				“Is that what y’ll do, cub?” Czigo asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3104">
				Paul’s voice was properly surly. “Yes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3105">
				The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the
				hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against
				the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed
				out with his right foot.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3106">
				The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of
				training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost
				every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip
				struck the soft part of Czigo’s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed
				upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to
				crush the right ventricle of the man’s heart.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3107">
				With one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats.
				Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand,
				landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his
				feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and
				held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the
				blade and freed his hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3108">
				“I could’ve handled him,” she said. “He’d have had to cut my bindings.
				That was a foolish risk.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3109">
				“I saw the opening and used it,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3110">
				She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: “Yueh’s house sign is
				scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3111">
				He looked up, saw the curling symbol.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3115">
				“Doubt it. There’s something peculiar here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3116">
				Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached
				under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo’s feet close to her
				face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the
				dampness was the pilot’s blood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3117">
				<i class="calibre2">Waste of moisture</i>, she thought, knowing that

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3118">
				Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert
				like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He
				turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the ’thopter, saw her
				stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what
				drew her attention, saw another ’thopter swooping toward them, realized
				they’d not have time to clear the bodies out of this ’thopter and
				escape.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3181">

				A bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3199">“Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.”</p>

				that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated
				white on the black. Porcelain white.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3228">
				But there was still the feeling of doubt.

				>dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia.
				There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed
				without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke’s eyes held a glazed,
				insane look.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3233">
				“Wel-l-l-l,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He

				<i class="calibre2">Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3235">
				“I believe the good Duke is drugged,” Piter said. “That’s how Yueh

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3236">
				The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3237">
				“What of the woman and the boy, Piter?” the Baron asked. “Any word yet?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3285">
				Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false

				“Perhaps on other portions of the body. It’s especially effective when

				on naked skin, eh, Baron?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3301">
				“Exquisite,” the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3302">
				<i class="calibre2">Those touching fingers!</i> Leto watched the fat

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3304">
				“Believe me, cher cousin,” the Baron said. “I do not want it to come to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3305">
				“You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,”
				Piter said. “There’s an artistry in this, you know.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3306">
				“You’re a superb artist,” the Baron growled. “Now, have the decency to
				be silent.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3307">
				Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a
				picture of the Baron:
				<i class="calibre2"

					the sea…and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.’”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3308">

				<i class="calibre2">He’s most likely correct,</i> Leto thought.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3313">
				The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth,

				<i class="calibre2">We must try a new tack</i>, he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3314">
				“Observe this prize person who denies he’s for hire,” the Baron said.
				“Observe him, Piter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3315">
				And the Baron thought:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3316">
				The frog sounds in the background stopped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3317">
				The Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway
				across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn’t produced the needed
				information. Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke,
				this stupid soft fool who didn’t realize how much hell there was so near
				him&mdash;only a nerve’s thickness away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3318">
				This thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal
				person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising
				endless supple scissor dissections&mdash;cutting away the masks from
				fools, exposing the hell beneath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3319">
				<i class="calibre2">Rabbits, all of them!</i>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3321">
				Leto stared across the table, wondering why he
				<span

					id="calibre_link-3322"

					title="296"></span
				>waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still&mdash;it had been
				good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite
				updangling in the shell-blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy
				at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on
				Arrakis&mdash;colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3323">
				“Too bad,” the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table,
				stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come
				over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline
				stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth
				shut.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3324">
				<i class="calibre2">How he fears me!</i> the Baron thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3325">
				Shocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the
				capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting
				vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller,
				a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his
				ear&mdash;the silky-voiced one: Piter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3326">
				<i class="calibre2">It got him, too!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3327">“Piter! What’s wrong?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3328">
				The rumbling voice was far away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3329">
				Leto sensed memories rolling in his mind&mdash;the old toothless
				mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified
				eyes&mdash;blue within blue, the eyes&mdash;all compressed around him in
				ruined symmetry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3330">
				There was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had
				a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever
				at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of
				crockery&mdash;so
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-3331"

					title="297"></span
				>distant&mdash;a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end,
				catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every
				whisper, every…silence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3332">
				One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of
				black:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes.</i
				>
				The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never
				explain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3333">Silence.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3334">
				The Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt
				hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His
				senses took in guards swarming around him.
				<i class="calibre2">Did I breathe it?</i> he asked himself.
				<i class="calibre2">Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3335">
				Sounds returned to him…and reason. He heard someone shouting
				orders&mdash;gas masks…keep a door closed…get blowers going.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3336">
				<i class="calibre2">The others fell quickly</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’m still standing. I’m still breathing. Merciless hell! That was
					close!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3337">
				He could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but
				still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And
				he had been pushing himself away from the table…that and Piter’s shocked
				gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own
				doom.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3338">
				Chance and the warning in a dying man’s gasp&mdash;these had saved him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3339">
				The Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed.
				And that stupid guard captain! He’d said he scoped everyone before
				bringing them into the Baron’s presence! How had it been possible for
				the Duke…?

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3341">
				<i class="calibre2">Well, no matter now</i>, the Baron thought, his mind
				firming.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these
					questions.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3342">
				He grew aware of more activity down the hall&mdash;around the corner at
				the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from
				his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring,
				silent, waiting for the Baron’s reaction.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3343">
				<i class="calibre2">Would the Baron be angry?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3344">
				And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight
				from that terrible room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3345">
				Some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing
				their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the
				noises around the corner to their right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3346">
				A man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps
				at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined
				this corridor. He was yellow-haired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp
				lines radiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water
				creature misplaced among those who walked the land.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3347">
				The Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud.
				Iakin Nefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the
				drug-music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness.
				A useful item of information, that.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3348">
				The man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. “Corridor’s
				<span

					id="calibre_link-3349"

				>clear, m’Lord. I was outside watching and saw that it must be poison
				gas. Ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors.”
				He glanced up at the snooper over the Baron’s head. “None of the stuff
				escaped. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3350">
				The Baron recognized the man’s voice&mdash;the one who’d been shouting
				orders. <i class="calibre2">Efficient, this corporal</i>, he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3351">
				“They’re all dead in there?” the Baron asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3352">“Yes, m’Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3353">
				<i class="calibre2">Well, we must adjust</i>, the Baron thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3354">
				“First,” he said, “let me congratulate you, Nefud. You’re the new
				captain of my guard. And I hope you’ll take to heart the lesson to be
				learned from the fate of your predecessor.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3355">
				The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman.
				Nefud knew he’d never again be without his semuta.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3356">
				Nefud nodded. “My Lord knows I’ll devote myself entirely to his safety.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3357">
				“Yes. Well, to business. I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth.
				You will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped
				him put it there. You’ll take every precaution&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3358">
				He broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the
				corridor behind him&mdash;guards at the door to the lift from the lower
				levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had
				just emerged from the lift.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3361">
				“Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!” the man roared, and
				he dashed the guards aside.
			</p>

				<i class="calibre2">Ah-h-h, one of the Sardaukar</i>, the Baron thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3363">
				The colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to
				slits of apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease.
				They all seemed to look like relatives of the Duke…the late Duke. And
				their manners with the Baron!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3364">
				The colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron,
				hands on hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3365">
				The Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar’s
				manner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them
				locally&mdash;ten brigades&mdash;reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but
				the Baron did not fool himself. That one legion was perfectly capable of
				turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3366">
				“Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron,” the
				Sardaukar growled. “My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could
				discuss his fate with you. We will discuss it now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3367">
				<i class="calibre2">I must not lose face before my men</i>, the Baron
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3368">
				“So?” It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3369">
				“My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly
				without agony,” the colonel bashar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3370">
				“Such were the Imperial orders to me,” the Baron lied. “Did you think

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3373">
				“The Duke’s already dead,” the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to
				dismiss the fellow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3374">
				The colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of
				eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. “How?” he
				growled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3375">
				<i class="calibre2">Really!</i> the Baron thought.
				<i class="calibre2">This is too much.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3376">
				“By his own hand, if you must know,” the Baron said. “He took poison.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3377">
				“I will see the body now,” the colonel bashar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3378">
				The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while
				his thoughts raced.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3379">
				“Now,” the Sardaukar growled. “I’ll see it with my own eyes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3380">
				There was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see
				all. He’d know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men…that the Baron most
				likely had escaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the
				dinner remnants on the table, and the dead Duke across from it with
				destruction around him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3381">No preventing it at all.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3382">
				“I’ll not be put off,” the colonel bashar snarled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3383">
				“You’re not being put off,” the Baron said, and he stared into the
				Sardaukar’s obsidian eyes. “I hide nothing from my Emperor.” He nodded
				to Nefud. “The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in
				by the door where you stood, Nefud.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3384">“This way, sir,” Nefud said.</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3388">
				And it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were
				alike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip,
				consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the
				Atreides raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice
				stores there.

				the ’thopter’s open door shouting: “Hurry! There’s wormsign south of
				you!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3420">
				But Paul had known as he turned who piloted the ’thopter. An

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3421">
				Across the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: “There can be
				only one explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh’s wife. He hated the
				Harkonnens! I cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has
				he saved us from the carnage?”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3424">
				“Do not try to forgive me,” Yueh had written. “I do not want your
				forgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done
				without malice or hope of another’s understanding. It is my own tahaddi
				al-burhan, my ultimate test. I give you the Atreides ducal signet as
				token that I write truly. By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3425">
				It had not been addressed or signed, but there’d been no mistaking the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3426">
				Remembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that
				moment&mdash;a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his
				new mental alertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the
				truth of the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to
				be entered in his mind and used.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3427">
				<i class="calibre2">I loved my father</i>, Paul thought, and knew this

				<i class="calibre2">I should mourn him. I should feel something.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3428">
				But he felt nothing except:
				<i class="calibre2">Here’s an important fact.</i>
			</p>

				It was one with all the other facts.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3434">
				But he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that

				of terrible purpose he’d first experienced in his ordeal with the
				Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right
				hand&mdash;the hand of remembered pain&mdash;tingled and throbbed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3435">

				“He was everything we thought him…and more,” Paul said. And he thought:

				“Such was not my suggestion,” he said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3440">
				She heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared

				His mother’s words had provoked another train of thought in Paul&mdash;a
				duke’s concern for all the people they’d lost this night.
				<i class="calibre2">People are the true strength of a Great House</i>,
				Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat’s words:

				Jessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son’s
				voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his
				mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than
				she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but now
				she found herself fearful of it. Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the
				lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.

				Jessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3460">
				“…back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3467">
				She weighed his words: <i class="calibre2">I expected it.</i> What had

				Paul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water
				gurgle there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent
				end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His
				left hand felt the sphincter-seal of the tent’s entrance. “It’ll be dawn
				soon,” he said. “We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through
				another night. In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade
				through the day.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3472">
				Remembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica’s mind:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Without a stillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five

				She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking
				how their lives depended on these garments.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3473">
				“If we leave here, Idaho can’t find us,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3474">
				“There are ways to make any man talk,” he said. “If Idaho hasn’t

				How long do you think he could hold out?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3475">
				The question required no answer, and she sat in silence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3476">
				Paul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with
				glowtab and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from
				the pages: “literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3478">
				So many things for survival on the desert.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3479">
				Presently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3480">
				“Where can we possibly go?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3481">
				“My father spoke of <i class="calibre2">desert power</i>,” Paul said.
				“The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it. They’ve never ruled

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3482">
				“Paul, you can’t think that&mdash;”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3483">
				“We’ve all the evidence in our hands,” he said. “Right here in this

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3484">
				“What’ve weather satellites to do with it?” she asked. “They couldn’t

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3485">
				Paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions,
				computing on minutiae. “You see it now,” he said. “Satellites watch the
				terrain below. There are things in the deep desert that will not bear
				frequent inspection.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3486">
				“You’re suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3487">She was so slow.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3488">
				“No!” he said. “The Fremen! They’re paying the Guild for privacy, paying

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3489">
				“Paul,” Jessica said, “you’re not a Mentat yet; you can’t know for sure

				He turned away from her, looking out into the night.
				<i class="calibre2">Why can’t I mourn?</i> he wondered. He felt that

				forever.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3495">
				Jessica had never heard such distress in her son’s voice. She wanted to
				reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him&mdash;but she sensed
				there was nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3496">
				The glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor
				caught her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: “Manual
				of ‘The Friendly Desert,’ the place full of life. Here are the ayat and
				burhan of Life. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3497">
				<i class="calibre2">It reads like the Azhar Book</i>, she thought,

				<i class="calibre2">Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3498">
				Paul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: “Think of

				sophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays
				depths no one suspected.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3499">
				Hesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica
				returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the
				Arrakeen sky: “Muad’Dib: The Mouse,” and noted that the tail pointed
				north.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3500">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3505">“My father is dead,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3506">
				She searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3507">
				Jessica nodded, unable to speak.

				“He wanted you to know he never suspected you,” Paul said, and explained

				And now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before
				had encompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to
				bear. He felt that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork
				control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him. It went on about
				its business no matter what he wanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of
				difference around him&mdash;a slight change in moisture, a fractional
				fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent
				roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he
				could see out the tent’s transparent end.

				The emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in
				motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the
				start of it&mdash;the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined
				pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible
				at a critical moment…and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he
				could look ahead&mdash;the most terrifying direction&mdash;to see where

				It was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3566">
				“Listen to me,” he said. “You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about

				“You and the spice,” Paul said. “The spice changes anyone who gets this

				Jessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against

				The other path held long patches of gray obscurity except for peaks of

					seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a
					Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the Guild and the evil old
					Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said
					I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to comfort him,
					saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to
					which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me
					and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been
					aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what
					that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think
					there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is
					certain that his line and Muad’Dib’s shared common ancestry.

				He found his stillsuit’s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3658">
				Jessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3661">The sand would not stop.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3662">
				Her dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous

				The tent’s glowtab came alight under Paul’s hand, filled the domed area

				She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3680">
				“Pass up the pack.” It was Paul’s voice, low and guarded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3681">

				“Here,” he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3683">
				Now she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips

				“Hurry up,” Paul said. “I want to collapse the tent.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3685">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3687">“No.”</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3690">Noise of small animals.</p>

				Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: “Duncan told me that if he was

				“Pillars of fire,” Paul whispered.

				“It must be Harkonnen ’thopters hunting us,” Paul said. “The way they’re

				He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from

				Their last ’thopter, the one they’d been using as a ground-effect
				machine to carry their wounded, had given out just before dawn. They had

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3753">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3754">
				The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to
				reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3781">
				“You wish our siding in a vendetta?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3782">
				“The vendetta I’ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3783">
				The Fremen scowled. “How can you be responsible for your wounded? They
				are their own responsibility. The water’s at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would
				you have me take that decision away from you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3784">
				The man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3785">
				Hawat tensed, wondering: <i class="calibre2">Is there betrayal here?</i>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3788">
				<i class="calibre2">These people and their disconcerting directness!</i>
				Hawat spoke cautiously. “There’s a price on my head.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3789">
				“Ah-h-h-h.” The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. “You think we
				have the Byzantine corruption. You don’t know us. The Harkonnens have
				not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3790">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand

				Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3791">
				“We both fight Harkonnens,” Hawat said. “Should we not share the
				problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3792">
				“We are sharing,” the Fremen said. “I have seen you fight Harkonnens.
				You are good. There’ve been times I’d have appreciated your arm beside
				me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3793">
				“Say where my arm may help you,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3794">
				“Who knows?” the Fremen asked. “There are Harkonnen forces everywhere.
				But you still have not made the water decision or put it to your
				wounded.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3795">
				<i class="calibre2">I must be cautious,</i> Hawat told himself.
				<i class="calibre2">There’s a thing here that’s not understood.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3796">
				He said: “Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3797">
				“Stranger-thinking,” the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone.
				He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop. “We watched you come

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3801">
				“What do you do with your own wounded?” Hawat demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3802">
				“Does a man not know when he is worth saving?” the Fremen asked. “Your
				wounded know you have no water.” He tilted his head, looking sideways up
				at Hawat. “This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and
				unwounded must look to the tribe’s future.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3803">
				<i class="calibre2">The tribe’s future,</i> Hawat thought.
				<i class="calibre2">The tribe of Atreides. There’s sense in that.</i> He
				forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3804">
				“Have you word of my Duke or his son?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3806">“Their fate!” Hawat snapped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3807">
				“Fate is the same for everyone,” the Fremen said. “Your Duke, it is

				Liet’s hands. Liet has not said.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3808">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3810">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3811">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3815">
				“We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,” the Fremen said. He

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3816">
				“You have ways of finding out?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3817">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3818">
				<i class="calibre2">The artillery,</i> Hawat thought bitterly.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3819">
				“You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves,”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3820">
				“Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3821">
				“Why do you ask about these weapons?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3822">“Liet wishes it.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3823">
				<i class="calibre2">Is that what he wants from us?</i> Hawat wondered.
				He said: “Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3824">
				“Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3825">
				“Then you should just go take one,” Hawat sneered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3826">
				“Yes,” the Fremen said. “We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar
				can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he

				Poor design for Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3827">“You…took one?” Hawat asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3828">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3831">
				“We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3832">
				One of Hawat’s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen.
				“Are you talking about Sardaukar?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3833">
				“He’s talking about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3834">
				“Sardaukar!” the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3835">“We…don’t know,” Hawat said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3836">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3837">
				“The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,”

				“But <i class="calibre2">you</i> know they are Sardaukar.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3839">
				“Who am I?” Hawat asked bitterly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3840">
				“You are Thufir Hawat,” the man said matter-of-factly. “Well, we would
				have learned it in time. We’ve sent three of them captive to be

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3841">
				Hawat’s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: “You…<i

				Sardaukar?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3842">

				<i class="calibre2"

				“Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,” the Fremen
				said. “If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3846">
				“I serve the…Lisan al-Gaib,” Hawat said. “His welfare is my concern.

				“You are pledged to his water?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3848">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3849">
				“You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3851">
				“Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?” The Fremen stood

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3852">
				Hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With
				a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation
				arise among the men.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3853">
				The Fremen said: “There is always a way to water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3854">
				Behind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat’s aide called: “Thufir! Arkie just
				died.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3855">
				The Fremen put a fist to his ear. “The bond of water! It’s a sign!” He
				stared at Hawat. “We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall
				I call my men?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3856">
				The aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: “Thufir, a couple of the men
				left wives in Arrakeen. They’re…well, you know how it is at a time like
				this.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3857">
				The Fremen still held his fist to his ear. “Is it the bond of water,
				Thufir Hawat?” he demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3858">
				<span

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3860">
				“The bond of water,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3861">
				“Let our tribes be joined,” the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3862">
				As though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the
				rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead
				man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the
				cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running
				feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3863">
				It was over before Hawat’s tired men could gather their wits. The group
				with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around
				a turn in the cliff.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3864">
				One of Hawat’s men shouted: “Where they going with Arkie? He was&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3865">
				“They’re taking him to…bury him,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3866">
				“Fremen don’t bury their dead!” the man barked. “Don’t you try any
				tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3867">
				“Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib,”
				the Fremen said. “If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said
				it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion
				will live as long as the memory of man endures.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3868">
				But Hawat’s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a
				lasgun. He started to draw it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3869">
				“Stop right where you are!” Hawat barked. He fought down the sick
				fatigue that gripped his muscles. “These
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3871">
				“They’re going to render Arkie down for his water,” the man with the
				lasgun snarled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3872">
				“Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?” the Fremen asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3873">
				<i class="calibre2">He doesn’t even see the problem,</i> Hawat thought.
				The naïveté of the Fremen was frightening.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3874">
				“They’re concerned for a respected comrade,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3875">
				“We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,”
				the Fremen said. “This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man’s
				flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3876">
				Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step.
				“Will you now help our wounded?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3877">
				“One does not question the bond,” the Fremen said. “We will do for you
				what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and
				see to the necessities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3878">
				The man with the lasgun hesitated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3879">
				Hawat’s aide said: “Are we buying help with Arkie’s…water?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3880">
				“Not buying,” Hawat said. “We’ve joined these people.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3881">
				“Customs differ,” one of his men muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3882">Hawat began to relax.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3883">
				“And they’ll help us get to Arrakeen?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3884">
				“We will kill Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. He grinned. “And Sardaukar.”
				He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his
				head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An
				aircraft
				<span

				>comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3886">
				At a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3887">
				The Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. “We will
				fight in the time of fighting,” the man said. He reached beneath his
				robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3888">
				Hawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its
				blue-within-blue eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3889">
				The Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over
				the animal’s head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into
				the bat’s upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on
				the Fremen’s opened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the
				bat’s head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high,
				he threw it upward.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3890">
				The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3891">
				The Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent
				his head, listening. “They quarter the high country,” he said. “One
				wonders who they seek up there.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3892">
				“It’s known that we retreated in this direction,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3893">
				“One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt,” the Fremen
				said. “Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3894">Time passed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3895">
				Some of Hawat’s men stirred, whispering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3896">
				“Remain silent as frightened animals,” the Fremen hissed.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3899">
				“My little friend carried his message,” the Fremen said. “He is a good
				messenger&mdash;day or night. I’ll be unhappy to lose that one.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3900">
				The movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five
				kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of
				the day’s heat&mdash;blurred columns of rising air.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3901">
				“Be most silent now,” the Fremen whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3902">
				A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff,
				headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen,
				but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it
				over the dunes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3903">
				A “thwok-thwok” of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind
				Hawat’s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them&mdash;an
				Atreides ’thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The
				’thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3904">
				The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3905">
				The ’thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a
				dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the
				’thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in
				their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3906">
				“Aiihh! They use their stupid shields,” the Fremen beside Hawat hissed.
				He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3907">
				“They are Sardaukar,” Hawat whispered.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3911">
				Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3912">

				“They left only three men in their ’thopter,” the Fremen beside Hawat

				taking it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3914">
				Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: “Those were Sardaukar!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3915">
				“Did you notice how well they fought?” the Fremen asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3916">
				Hawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt
				the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes,
				they fought well, indeed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3917">
				The captured ’thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled
				upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3918">
				<i class="calibre2">So these Fremen can handle ’thopters, too,</i> Hawat

				On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once…twice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3920">
				“More come!” the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. I’d hoped to
				have us away without more inconvenience.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3924">
				Another ’thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a
				sharp breath as he saw it&mdash;a big troop carrier. It flew with the
				slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load&mdash;like a giant bird
				coming to its nest.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3925">
				In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of
				the diving ’thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of
				dust.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3926">
				“The cowards!” the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3927">
				The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3928">
				Hawat’s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a
				’thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its
				sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the
				sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was
				unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the
				carrier the diving ’thopter plunged.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3929">
				A flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all
				around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the

				caught in the flame.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3933">
				A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him,
				falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had

				that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a
				stunner in the other.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3934">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3963">
				He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing

				The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3973">
				Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his

				mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3974">
				In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3975">
				Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the

				youth&mdash;and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3976">
				Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3977">
				“This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father

				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3982">
				Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and
				new sounds started there&mdash;machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3983">
				Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them
				stacked against the wall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3984">
				“You’ve recognized this place correctly,” Kynes said. “For what would

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3985">
				“To make this planet a fit place for humans,” Paul said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3987">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3988">
				Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were
				brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall
				across the cages.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3989">
				A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes:
				“Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. I am unable to mask

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3990">
				“Can you repair it?” Kynes asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3991">
				“Not quickly. The parts….” The man shrugged.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-3992">

				“Immediately.” The man hurried away.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4003">
				Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor.
				He heard the door close behind him, studied the place&mdash;about eight
				meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal

				full of yellow bubbles occupied the room’s center. Four suspensor chairs
				ringed the desk.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4004">
				Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4042">
				“One of the tools of statecraft, as you’ve said yourself,” Paul said,
				and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. “The Emperor has no sons,
				only daughters.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4043">
				“You’d aim for the throne?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4044">
				“The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war,”
				Paul said. “Planets blasted, disorder everywhere&mdash;he’ll not risk
				that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4045">
				“This is a desperate gamble you propose,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4046">
				“What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?” Paul asked. “They
				fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis&mdash;the
				Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That’s why there
				<i class="calibre2">is</i> a Landsraad. This is the glue of the Great
				Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4047">“But they’re&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4048">
				“This is what they fear,” Paul said. “Arrakis would become a rallying
				cry. Each of them would see himself in my father&mdash;cut out of the
				herd and killed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4049">
				Kynes spoke to Jessica: “Would his plan work?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4050">
				“I’m no Mentat,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4051">“But you are Bene Gesserit.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4052">
				She shot a probing stare at him, said: “His plan has good points and bad
				points…as any plan would at

				>this stage. A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon
				concept.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4054">
				“‘Law is the ultimate science,’” Paul quoted. “Thus it reads above the
				Emperor’s door. I propose to show him law.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4055">
				“And I’m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,”
				Kynes said. “Arrakis has its own plan that we&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4056">
				“From the throne,” Paul said, “I could make a paradise of Arrakis with
				the wave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your support.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4057">
				Kynes stiffened. “My loyalty’s not for sale,
				<i class="calibre2">Sire.</i>”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4058">
				Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those
				blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding
				appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul’s lips and he said: “Well spoken.
				I apologize.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4059">
				Kynes met Paul’s stare and, presently, said: “No Harkonnen ever admitted
				error. Perhaps you’re not like them, Atreides.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4060">
				“It could be a fault in their education,” Paul said. “You say you’re not
				for sale, but I believe I’ve the coin you’ll accept. For your loyalty I
				offer <i class="calibre2">my</i> loyalty to you…totally.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4061">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4062">
				She saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4063">
				“This is nonsense,” Kynes said. “You’re just a boy and&mdash;”
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4066">Kynes swallowed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4067">
				“When I say totally,” Paul said, “I mean without reservation. I would
				give my life for you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4068">
				“Sire!” Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that
				he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a
				superior. Now Kynes meant the word.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4069">
				<i class="calibre2">In this moment he’d give his life for Paul,</i> she

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4070">
				“I know you mean this,” Kynes said. “Yet the Harkon&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4071">
				The door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling
				violence&mdash;shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing
				in the passage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4072">
				With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho
				blocking the passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible through a
				shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at
				the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth of a stunner repelled by the
				shield. Idaho’s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping
				from them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4073">
				Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4074">
				Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen
				uniforms&mdash;his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair
				with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there
				came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.

				>“I appear to’ve decided,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4077">
				“Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,” Paul said. He
				pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4078">
				“I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,” Kynes
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4079">
				“You’ve a bolt hole out of here,” Paul said. “Shall we use it?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4080">
				Kynes took a deep breath, said: “This door should hold for at least
				twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4081">
				“They’ll not use a lasgun for fear we’ve shields on this side,” Paul
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4082">
				“Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,” Jessica whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4083">
				They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4084">
				Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: “This
				way.” He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a
				handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the
				black mouth of a tunnel. “This door also is plasteel,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4085">
				“You were well prepared,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4086">
				“We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,” Kynes said. He herded
				them into the darkness, closed the door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4087">
				In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead
				of her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4088">
				Kynes’ voice came from behind them: “We’ll separate here. This wall is
				tougher. It’ll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that
				one on the floor. They’ll be extinguished by your passage. They lead
				through a maze
				<span

				>to another exit where I’ve secreted a ’thopter. There’s a storm across
				the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into
				the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing
				’thopters. If you stay high in the storm you’ll survive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4090">“What of you?” Paul asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4091">
				“I’ll try to escape another way. If I’m captured…well, I’m still
				Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4092">
				<i class="calibre2">Running like cowards,</i> Paul thought.
				<i class="calibre2">But how else can I live to avenge my father?</i> He
				turned to face the door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4093">
				Jessica heard him move, said, “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound.
				You can do nothing for him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4094">
				“I’ll take full payment for them all one day,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4095">
				“Not unless you hurry now,” Kynes said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4096">
				Paul felt the man’s hand on his shoulder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4097">
				“Where will we meet, Kynes?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4098">
				“I’ll send Fremen searching for you. The storm’s path is known. Hurry
				now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4099">
				They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4100">
				Jessica found Paul’s hand, pulled him gently. “We must not get
				separated,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4101">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4102">
				He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they
				touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4103">
				They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4104">They were running now.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4105">
				<i class="calibre2">Plans within plans within plans within plans</i>,
				Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Have we become part of someone else’s plan now?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4106">
				<span

				>The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly
				sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time,
				then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were
				brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its
				center.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4108">Paul pressed the handle.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4109">
				The wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern
				with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a
				doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4110">
				“Where did Kynes go?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4111">
				“He did what any good guerrilla leader would,” Paul said. “He separated
				us into two parties and arranged that he couldn’t reveal where we are if
				he’s captured. He won’t really know.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4112">
				Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the
				floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4113">
				“No one’s been here for a long time,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4114">
				“He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4115">“I share that confidence.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4116">
				Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter’s left door, opened
				it, and secured his pack in the rear. “This ship’s proximity masked,” he
				said. “Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty
				years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4117">
				Jessica leaned against the craft’s other side, catching her breath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4118">
				“The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,” she said.
				“They’re not stupid.” She considered her
				<span

				>direction sense, pointed right. “The storm we saw is that way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4120">
				Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause,
				but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a
				decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding
				them, but the here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as
				though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a
				valley. Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a
				Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4121">
				“The longer we wait the better prepared they’ll be,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4122">
				“Get in and strap yourself down,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4123">
				He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that
				this was <i class="calibre2">blind</i> ground, unseen in any prescient
				vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been
				giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened
				him for this particular emergency.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4124">
				“If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.” It was a Bene
				Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall
				into that trap…if he lived through this.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4125">
				Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure,
				checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate
				metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the
				wings shorten for jet-boost takeoff the way Gurney Halleck had taught
				him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument
				<span

				hissing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4127">“Ready?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4128">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4129">
				He touched the remote control for lights.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4130">Darkness blanketed them.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4131">
				His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the
				remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand
				swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed
				his door, feeling the sudden pressure.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4132">
				A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared
				where the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a
				suggestion of sand ripples.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4133">
				Paul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The
				wings snapped back and down, hurling the ’thopter out of its nest. Power
				surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4134">
				Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the
				sureness of her son’s movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated.
				<i class="calibre2">Now, Paul’s training is our only hope,</i> she
				thought. <i class="calibre2">His youth and swiftness.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4135">
				Paul fed more power to the jetpods. The ’thopter banked, sinking them
				into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave
				the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and
				they came out over rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the
				starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon
				to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4138">
				“Jetflares behind us!” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4139">“I saw them.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4140">
				He slammed the power arm forward.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4141">
				Their ’thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward
				the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw
				scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement
				complex sinking beneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail
				shadows&mdash;dunes diminishing one into another.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4142">
				And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a
				wall against the stars.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4143">
				Something jarred the ’thopter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4144">
				“Shellburst!” Jessica gasped. “They’re using some kind of projectile
				weapon.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4145">
				She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul’s face. “They seem to be avoiding
				their lasguns,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4146">“But we’ve no shields!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4147">“Do they know that?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4148">Again the ’thopter shuddered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4149">
				Paul twisted to peer back. “Only one of them appears to be fast enough
				to keep up with us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4150">
				He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow
				high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4151">
				“Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry&mdash;that’s
				one thing we’ll give the Fremen,” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4152">
				“The storm,” Jessica said. “Hadn’t you better turn?”
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4156">“Now!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4157">
				Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow
				boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4158">
				They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier
				and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft
				became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green
				luminosity of the instrument panel.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4159">
				Through Jessica’s mind flashed all the warnings about such
				storms&mdash;that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and
				ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It
				twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw him chop the power,
				felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4160">“Sand!” Jessica shouted.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4161">
				She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. “Not
				much sand this high.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4162">
				But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4163">
				Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with
				the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by
				instinct, fighting for altitude.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4164">
				The sound of their passage diminished.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4165">
				The ’thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing
				globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4166">

				<i class="calibre2">Fear is the mind-killer.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4169">
				Slowly her long years of training prevailed.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4170">Calmness returned.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4172">
				Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4173">
				“Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total

				Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

				The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his

				The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his

				“Ah-h-h, I see,” Rabban murmured.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4310">
				And the Baron thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that

				The Baron suddenly wondered at himself.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of

				The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4311">
				“It must be kept secret,” Rabban said. “I understand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4312">
				The Baron sighed. “I give you different instructions about Arrakis this
				time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein.
				This time, I have only one requirement.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4313">“M’Lord?”</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4316">
				“Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4318">“Expensive, eh?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4319">“Expensive!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4320">
				The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. “If you squeeze Arrakis for
				every cent it can give us for sixty years, you’ll just barely repay us!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4321">
				Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4322">
				“Expensive,” the Baron sneered. “The damnable Guild monopoly on space
				would’ve ruined us if I hadn’t planned for this expense long ago. You
				should know, Rabban, that <i class="calibre2">we</i> bore the entire

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4323">
				And not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come
				a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were

				until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and
				pay and pay.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4324">
				Always, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. “Hazard

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4341">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4357">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4369">
				“You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4370">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4376">
				“Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You

				you show them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4377">
				“Can one exterminate an entire planet?” Rabban asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4378">
				“Exterminate?” Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron’s head.
				“Who said anything about exterminating?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4379">
				“Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and&mdash;”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4380">
				“I said <i class="calibre2">squeeze,</i> Nephew, not exterminate. Don’t

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4381">“I see, m’Lord.”</p>

				Presently, the Baron said: “Incidentally, you will make my own supply

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4445">
				Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing,
				weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side

				mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin,
				bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear,
				saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the
				side of the right-hand seat and out onto the ’thopter’s metal skin. Paul
				followed, dragging the pack by its straps.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4447">“Run!” he ordered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4448">

				>Jessica leaped off the ’thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the

				sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4451">
				“Follow the ridge,” Paul ordered. “It’ll be faster.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4452">
				They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4453">
				A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing,
				an abrasive slithering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4454">“Worm,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4455">It grew louder.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4456">“Faster!” Paul gasped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4457">
				The first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more
				than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind
				them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4458">
				Paul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It
				slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother’s arm with his other
				hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface
				through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in
				their throats.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4459">
				“I can’t run any farther,” Jessica panted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4460">
				Paul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down
				onto the desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock
				island&mdash;moonlit ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level
				with Paul’s eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes
				of its track curved once&mdash;a short loop crossing the patch of desert
				where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4463">
				The burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its
				own path, questing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4464">
				“It’s bigger than a Guild spaceship,” Paul whispered. “I was told worms
				grew large in the deep desert, but I didn’t realize…how big.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4465">“Nor I,” Jessica breathed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4466">
				Again, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curbing
				track toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage
				was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4467">
				Paul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and
				quoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: “Travel by night and rest in black shade
				through the day.” He looked at his mother. “We still have a few hours of
				night. Can you go on?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4468">“In a moment.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4469">
				Paul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted
				its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4470">
				“Whenever you’re ready,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4471">
				She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return.
				“Which direction?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4472">
				“Where this ridge leads.” He pointed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4473">
				“Deep into the desert,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4474">
				“The Fremen desert,” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4475">
				And he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a
				prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert.
				But the <i class="calibre2">set</i> of the vision
				<span

				>had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared
				into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of
				perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared
				to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he
				remained motionless.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4477">
				<i class="calibre2">Idaho was with us in the vision,</i> he remembered.
				<i class="calibre2">But now Idaho is dead.</i>
			</p>

				“Do you see a way to go?” Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4479">
				“No,” he said. “But we’ll go anyway.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4480">
				He settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a
				sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor
				of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4481">
				Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4482">
				She noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate
				and particular&mdash;the sand pockets between rocks where their steps
				were slowed, the wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction
				that forced a choice: Go over or go around? The terrain enforced its own
				rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices
				of their exertion.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4483">
				“Careful here&mdash;this ledge is slippery with sand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4484">
				“Watch you don’t hit your head against this overhang.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4485">
				“Stay below this ridge; the moon’s at our backs and it’d show our
				movement to anyone out there.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4486">

				>Jessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard
				Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It
				tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan&mdash;a tall
				fountain enclosing a curve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it
				hadn’t been noticed for itself…only for its shape, or its reflection, or
				its sound as she stopped beside it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4489">
				<i class="calibre2">To stop,</i> she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">To rest…truly rest.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4490">
				It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a
				moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4491">
				Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping
				surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4492">
				They slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face.
				Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this
				broken land.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4493">
				Jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in
				substances beneath their feet and hands&mdash;boulders or pea gravel or
				flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer
				powder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4494">
				The powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and
				pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock
				flakes cut.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4495">
				And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4496">
				Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she
				stumbled into him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4497">
				He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood
				atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two
				hundred meters below.
				<span

				>It lay there full of moon-silvered waves&mdash;shadows of angles that

				of another escarpment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4499">“Open desert,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4500">
				“A wide place to cross,” Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the
				filter trap across his face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4501">
				Jessica glanced left and right&mdash;nothing but sand below.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4502">
				Paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement
				of shadows in the moon’s passage. “About three or four kilometers
				across,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4503">“Worms,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4504">“Sure to be.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4505">
				She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses.
				“Shall we rest and eat?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4506">
				Paul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica
				supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock
				beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him
				scrabbling in the pack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4507">“Here,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4508">
				His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into
				her palm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4509">
				She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit
				tube.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4510">
				“Drink all your water,” Paul said. “Axiom: the best place to conserve
				your water is in your body. It keeps your energy up. You’re stronger.
				Trust your stillsuit.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4511">
				She obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought
				then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she
				recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, “Better a
				dry
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-4512"

				>morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and
				strife.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4513">
				Jessica repeated the words to Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4514">“That was Gurney,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4515">
				She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead,
				thought: <i class="calibre2">And well poor Gurney might be dead</i>. The
				Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themselves in
				this waterless void.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4516">
				“Gurney always had the right quotation,” Paul said. “I can hear him now:
				‘And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the
				wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the
				hand of strangers.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4517">
				Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the
				pathos in her son’s voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4518">
				Presently, Paul said: “How do you…feel?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4519">
				She recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said:
				“Your sister won’t be born for many months yet. I still feel…physically
				adequate.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4520">
				And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2">How stiffly formal I speak to my own son!</i> Then,
				because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to
				such an oddity, she searched and found the source of her formality:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’m afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; I fear what he may see
					ahead of us, what he may tell me</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4521">
				Paul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling
				sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His
				nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the
				rich smell of cinnamon.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4522">
				<span

					title="399"></span
				>“There’s melange spice nearby,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4524">
				An eider wind feathered Paul’s cheeks, ruffled the folds of his
				burnoose. But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could
				sense the difference.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4525">“Dawn soon,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4526">Jessica nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4527">
				“There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,” Paul said. “The
				Fremen do it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4528">“The worms?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4529">
				“If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,”
				Paul said. “It’d keep a worm occupied for a time.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4530">
				She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the
				other escarpment. “Four kilometers’ worth of time?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4531">
				“Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only
				<i class="calibre2">natural</i> sounds, the kind that don’t attract the
				worms….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4532">
				Paul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing
				the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit
				manual that had come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he
				sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms. He knew as though
				it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be
				respected and not feared…if…if….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4533">He shook his head.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4534">
				“It’d have to be sounds without rhythm,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4535">
				“What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps…the sand itself must shift down at
				times. Worms can’t investigate every little sound. We should be fully
				rested before we try it, though.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4536">
				<span

				>He looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in
				the vertical moonshadows there. “It’ll be dawn within the hour.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4538">
				“Where’ll we spend the day?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4539">
				Paul turned left, pointed. “The cliff curves back north over there. You
				can see by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward face. There’ll be
				crevasses there, deep ones.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4540">
				“Had we better get started?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4541">
				He stood, helped her to her feet. “Are you rested enough for a climb
				down? I want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we
				camp.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4542">
				“Enough.” She nodded for him to lead the way.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4543">
				He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and
				turned along the cliff.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4544">
				<i class="calibre2">If only we had suspensors</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>It’d be such a simple matter to jump down there. But perhaps
					suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert. Maybe they
					attract the worms the way a shield does</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4545">
				They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a
				fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the
				vestibule.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4546">
				Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was
				obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a
				world of deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the
				stars around them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at the
				brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4547">
				“Can we go down?” Jessica whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4548">“I think so.”</p>

				stop.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4552">“Careful,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4553">
				He stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface
				onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the
				rock walls.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4554">
				There came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the
				slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It
				trailed away to silence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4555">“Mother?” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4556">There was no answer.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4557">“Mother?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4558">
				He dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging,
				throwing sand like a wild man. “Mother!” he gasped. “Mother, where are
				you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4559">
				Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He
				wrenched himself out of it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4560">
				<i class="calibre2">She’s been caught in the sandslide</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4561">
				In the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage
				beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past
				few moments could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the
				slide replayed itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness
				that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the
				total recall.

				>Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until
				he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to
				dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of
				fabric came under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he
				traced the arm, exposed her face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4564">
				“Do you hear me?” he whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4565">No answer.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4566">
				He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but
				he detected a slow heartbeat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4567">
				<i class="calibre2">Bindu suspension</i>, he told himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4568">
				He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his
				shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as
				fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he
				pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting to keep his balance. He
				was out on the hard-packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to
				his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope
				came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock
				walls.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4569">
				He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert’s
				marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the
				sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4570">
				She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4571">
				“I knew you’d find me,” she whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4572">

				place where we’ll die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4578">
				In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left
				beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the
				open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places
				among the rocks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4579">
				But Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul’s face. She edged her

				“Don’t you understand?” he asked. “Everything we need to survive in this

				“You found me,” she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.

				Paul squatted back on his heels.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4583">
				Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it,
				marking the looseness of the sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4584">
				“If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of

				off, then: “Foam.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4585">
				Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning
				of his mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4586">
				Paul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well

				darkened patch of sand below them.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4589">
				Jessica sat up straight against the rock.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4590">
				Paul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the
				wind-compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the
				desert’s floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4591">
				She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride&mdash;step…pause,
				step-step…slide…pause…
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4592">
				There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not
				of the desert moved here.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4593">
				Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his
				robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in
				front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using
				the point of his knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash,
				spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial
				mechanism came out next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the
				instrument.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4594">
				“You’ll need water,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4595">
				Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it
				into the dished compartment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4596">
				<i class="calibre2">If this fails, that’s water wasted</i>, Jessica
				thought. <i class="calibre2">But it won’t matter then, anyway</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4597">
				With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into
				the water. They foamed slightly, subsided.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4598">
				Jessica’s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of
				hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at
				the open water.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4599">
				<i class="calibre2">Great Mother!</i> she thought.

				>Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset
				button which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked
				instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back
				up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently
				without the sash to hold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off
				the sand rivulets, spurts of dust.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4602">
				Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the
				paracompass, shook the instrument case.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4603">
				Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul
				aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the
				sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4604">
				Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: “May I help?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4605">
				“Come up and dig,” he said. “We’ve about three meters to go. It’s going
				to be a near thing.” As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the
				instrument.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4606">
				“Quickly,” Paul said. “No telling how long this foam will hold the
				sand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4607">
				Jessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice
				into the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4608">
				As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling
				the sand down the slope. “How deep?” she panted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4609">
				“About three meters,” he said. “And I can only approximate the position.
				We may have to widen this hole.” He moved a step aside, slipping in
				loose sand. “Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4612">
				Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the
				basin and still no sign of the pack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4613">
				<i class="calibre2">Could I have miscalculated?</i> Paul asked himself.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4614">
				He looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion
				remained.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4615">
				Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her
				cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4616">
				“The upper face,” Paul said. “Gently, now.” He added another pinch of
				spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica’s hands as
				she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the
				second pass, her hands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked
				out a length of strap with a plastic buckle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4617">
				“Don’t move any more of it,” Paul said and his voice was almost a
				whisper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4618">“We’re out of foam.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4619">
				Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4620">
				Paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said:
				“Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I’m going to pull you to
				the side and downhill. Don’t let go of that strap. We won’t get much
				more spill from the top. This slope has stabilized itself. All I’m going
				to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand. Once that hole’s
				filled, we can dig you out and pull up the pack.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4621">“I understand,” she said.</p>

				>“Ready.” She tensed her fingers on the strap.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4625">
				With one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up
				as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had
				subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and
				shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected on a fold of Paul’s
				robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain put on it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4626">
				“I still have the strap,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4627">
				Slowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap.
				“Together,” he said. “Steady pressure. We mustn’t break it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4628">
				More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap
				cleared the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand.
				Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4629">
				In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack
				between them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4630">
				Paul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was
				caked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been
				a target for balls of wet, green sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4631">“You look a mess,” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4632">
				“You’re not so pretty yourself,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4633">
				They started to laugh, then sobered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4634">
				“That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4635">
				She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4636">
				“I’ll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it
				out.” He turned away, taking the pack.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4640">
				<i class="calibre2">Why not?</i> she thought as she brushed at her robe.
				This was a likely place&mdash;deep in rock walls and facing another
				cliff some four kilometers away&mdash;far enough above the desert to
				avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4641">
				She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere
				blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her,
				lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick
				twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff, lifting golden tan in
				morning light across open sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4642">
				Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes
				probing into sand rivers and canyons.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4643">
				“There are growing things over there,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4644">

				beside Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4645">
				“There,” he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with
				the other.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4646">She looked where he pointed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4647">
				“Saguaro,” she said. “Scrawny stuff.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4648">
				“There may be people nearby,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4649">
				“That could be the remains of a botanical testing station,” she warned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4650">
				“This is pretty far south into the desert,” he said. He lowered his
				binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and
				chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth.
				“This has the feeling of a Fremen place,” he said.

				She closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a
				scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on
				Caladan&mdash;she and the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown
				over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice
				paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the
				greenery&mdash;man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed
				shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there’d been the white petals of
				trimaran dhows.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4656">All of it gone.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4657">
				Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth
				of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver
				out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a
				thing seen through cheap glass.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4658">
				A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the
				fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the
				hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the
				sand-fall was gone, she still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound
				that once heard, was never forgotten.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4659">“Worm,” Paul whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4660">
				It came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be
				ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within
				their field of vision. The
				<span

					id="calibre_link-4661"

				was gone, coursing off to the left.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4662">The sound diminished, died.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4663">
				“I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4664">
				She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had
				passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless
				before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4665">
				“When we’ve rested,” Jessica said, “we should continue with your

			</p>

				He suppressed a sudden anger, said: “Mother, don’t you think we could do

				“Today you panicked,” she said. “You know your mind and bindu-nervature

				can teach you about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every

				“Come, into the tent, now.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4668">
				He flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4683">

				It took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened

				He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had
				been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out
				of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray
				burners for the job. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue
				the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal
				air-convection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4783">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4785">
				The Atreides training&mdash;<i class="calibre2"

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4786">
				One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string
				baliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: “Sir, the
				medics here say there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ
				banks here&mdash;only outpost medicine. Mattai can’t last, they say, and
				he has a request of you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4787">“What is it?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4788">
				The lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. “Mattai wants a song to ease

				If you&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4789">
				“I know.” Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its
				catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument,
				found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his
				eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward,
				strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile casually.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4790">
				Several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the

					>Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to
					understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My
					father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir
					Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the
					Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new
					slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother
					to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of
					self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under
					the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal
					Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their
					similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding
					subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but
					I’m not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A
					Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new
					slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and
					graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had
					included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as
					she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: “She is too
					beautiful. We will save her as a gift.” You have no idea how much
					consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and
					self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.

				heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of
				sound&mdash;the desert’s own code spelling out its measure of safety.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4842">
				“We must walk without rhythm,” Paul said and he called up memory of men
				walking the sand…both prescient memory and real memory.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4843">
				“Watch how I do it,” he said. “This is how Fremen walk the sand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4844">
				He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve
				of it, moved with a dragging pace.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4845">
				Jessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She
				saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of
				sand…like the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken
				pattern: Step…drag…drag…step…step…wait…drag…step….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4846">
				Time stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no
				nearer. The one behind still towered high.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4847">“Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4848">
				It was a drumming from the cliff behind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4849">“The thumper,” Paul hissed.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4853">
				They moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down
				and up through spilling dunes: step…drag…wait…step…. Across pea sand
				that rolled under their feet: drag…wait…step….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4854">
				And all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4855">
				The sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage
				masked it. But it grew…louder and louder…out of the west.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4856">
				“Lump…lump…lump…lump….” drummed the thumper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4857">
				The hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned
				their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4858">
				“Keep moving,” Paul whispered. “Don’t look back.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4859">
				A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It
				was a flailing avalanche of noise.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4860">
				“Keep moving,” Paul repeating.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4861">
				He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock
				faces&mdash;the one ahead and the one behind&mdash;appeared equally
				remote.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4862">
				And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks
				dominated the night.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4863">
				They moved on and on and on…. Muscles reached a stage of mechanical
				aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4866">“Lump…lump….”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4867">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4868">Silence!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4869">“Faster,” Paul whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4870">
				She nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action
				to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles
				that already were being taxed to their limits&mdash;the unnatural
				movement….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4871">
				The rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul
				saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it,
				stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary
				outthrusting of a foot.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4872">
				Resonant booming shook the sand around them.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4873">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4875">“Drum sand!” Jessica hissed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4876">
				Paul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around
				them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4877">
				Behind them, he heard a hissing&mdash;like the wind, like a riptide
				where there was no water.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4878">
				“Run!” Jessica screamed. “Paul, run!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4879">They ran.</p>

				dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm
				sound that grew around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4882">
				Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue
				and the sound and the terror.
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4884">They ran on, hand in hand.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4886">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4891">
				A deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead
				of them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4892">
				Behind them, the sound of the worm’s passage stopped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4893">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4894">
				Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4896">
				The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled.
				Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4897">
				Back and forth the great mouth wove.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4898">Paul stilled his breathing.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4899">Jessica crouched staring.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4900">
				It took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down
				the primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill
				her mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4901">
				Paul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a
				time barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness
				ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he
				had taken had plunged him into a well…or into the trough of a wave where
				the future was invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound
				shifting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4902">
				Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a
				hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering
				every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there
				seeking him. Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter…crystal teeth
				with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim…the bellows
				breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes…Acids….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4903">
				The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A
				shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4904">
				Paul crowded his mother farther back.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4909">“Barrrroooom!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4910">
				It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4911">Again: “Barrrroooom!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4912">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4914">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4915">
				Again it sounded off to their right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4916">
				A shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand.
				Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of
				a tunnel rearing above the dunes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4917">Sand rasped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4918">
				The creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4919">
				Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4932">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4933">
				An answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come.

				barbed sticks in their packs&mdash;the “maker hooks.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4934">
				“Why would they call a worm?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4935">
				A breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4936">

				“They mark a way up the cliff,” Paul said. He settled his shoulders into

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4941">
				Paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the
				precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to
				slow caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched
				away upward, open to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only
				sounds he could expect&mdash;a tiny spill of sand, an insect
				<i class="calibre2">brrr</i>, the patter of a small running creature. He
				tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a
				gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his
				mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her
				around.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4942">
				They looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his
				mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement. “If we could only risk a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4943">
				“We have other senses than eyes,” she said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4944">
				Paul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other
				foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4945">Another step.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4946">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4950">
				Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: “What a beautiful
				place.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4951">
				Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4952">
				In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the
				confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4953">
				“Like a fairyland,” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4954">Jessica nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4955">
				Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth&mdash;bushes,
				cacti, tiny clumps of leaves&mdash;all trembling in the moonlight. The
				ringwalls were dark to her left, moon-frosted on her right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4956">
				“This must be a Fremen place,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4957">
				“There would have to be people for this many plants to survive,” she
				agreed. She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit’s catchpockets, sipped at
				it. Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how

				replaced it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4958">
				Movement caught Paul’s attention&mdash;to his right and down on the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4959">“Mice!” he hissed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4960">

				<i class="calibre2">We needed that reminder</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4964">
				Paul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly
				cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory
				bird&mdash;he thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a
				stillness to the basin so unuttered that the blue-milk moonlight could
				almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbush.
				There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any
				other music in his universe.

				“Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4967">
				It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the
				moment. The voice came from above them and to their right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4968">
				“Please do not run, intruders,” the voice said as Paul made to withdraw
				into the defile. “If you run you’ll only waste your body’s water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4969">
				<i class="calibre2">They want us for the water of our flesh!</i> Jessica
				thought. Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness
				without external betrayal. She pinpointed the location of the voice,
				thinking: <i class="calibre2">Such stealth! I didn’t hear him</i>. And
				she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the
				small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4970">

				Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt
				chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded

				the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4973">
				Still, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was

				>the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak,
				but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of
				sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows.
				Beneath the blue-within-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down
				to his cheeks. A matted depression across mustache and beard showed
				where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to
				catchpockets.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4991">
				The man stopped half across the dune crest, arms stretched down the
				slipface. Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs.
				Patches of yellow-gray sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his
				hands under him, pushed himself to his feet, stood there swaying. And
				even in this almost-random action there remained a trace of once-precise
				movement.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4992">
				“I am Liet-Kynes,” he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and
				his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. “I am
				His Imperial Majesty’s Planetologist,” he whispered, “planetary
				ecologist for Arrakis. I am steward of this land.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4993">
				He stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward
				face. His hands dug feebly into the sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4994">
				<i class="calibre2">I am steward of this sand</i>, he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4995">
				He realized that he was semidelirious, that he should dig himself into
				the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it.
				But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre-spice
				pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this
				fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the
				pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses

				His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4998">
				A thought spread across his mind&mdash;clear, distinct:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in
					that basic source of civilization&mdash;agriculture</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-4999">
				And he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single
				track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him
				here without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the
				desert didn’t. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by
				inches at the impersonal hands of his planet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5000">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen</i

				“The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5002">
				The voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it
				was dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here
				before him&mdash;his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster
				Basin.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5003">
				“Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,” his father said. “You

				<i class="calibre2">I’m delirious</i>, Kynes thought.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5005">
				The voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5007">
				“The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for
				life,” his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from
				behind him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5008">
				<i class="calibre2">Why does he keep moving around?</i> Kynes asked
				himself. <i class="calibre2">Doesn’t he want me to see him?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5009">
				“Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,” his
				father said. “Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5010">
				<i class="calibre2">Why does he keep harping on the same subject?</i>
				Kynes asked himself.
				<i class="calibre2">I knew that before I was ten</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5011">
				Desert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures,
				began to circle over him. Kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand, forced
				his head farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch
				on silver-blue sky&mdash;distant flecks of soot floating above him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5012">
				“We are generalists,” his father said. “You can’t draw neat lines around

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5013">
				<i class="calibre2">What’s he trying to tell me?</i> Kynes wondered.
				<i class="calibre2">Is there some consequence I failed to see?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5014">
				His cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned
				rock odor beneath the pre-spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his
				mind, a thought formed:
				<i class="calibre2"

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5018">
				He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5019">
				His fingers clawed feebly at the sand.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5020">
				<i class="calibre2">They couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5021">
				“The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation
				from living bodies,” his father said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5022">
				<i class="calibre2">Why does he keep repeating the obvious?</i> Kynes
				wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5023">
				He tried to think of moisture in the air&mdash;grass covering this
				dune…open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water
				open to the sky except in text illustrations. Open water…irrigation
				water…it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one
				hectare of land per growing season, he remembered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5024">
				“Our first goal on Arrakis,” his father said, “is grassland provinces.
				We will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture
				locked in grasslands, we’ll move on to start upland forests, then a few
				open bodies of water&mdash;small at first&mdash;and situated along lines
				of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the
				lines to recapture what the wind steals. We
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5026">
				<i class="calibre2">Always lecturing me</i>, Kynes thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Why doesn’t he shut up? Can’t he see I’m dying?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5027">
				“You will die, too,” his father said, “if you don’t get off the bubble
				that’s forming right now deep underneath you. It’s there and you know
				it. You can smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are
				beginning to lose some of their water into the mass.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5028">
				The thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it
				now&mdash;sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery
				half-plant, half-animal little makers&mdash;and the thin rupture that
				was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing water
				into….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5029">
				<i class="calibre2">A pre-spice mass!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5030">
				He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around
				him than it had been.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5031">
				Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried
				flapping of wings.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5032">
				<i class="calibre2">This is spice desert</i>, he thought.

				“Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,” his
				father said. “Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement

				movement now, align it for our purposes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5034">
				“Shut up, old man,” Kynes muttered.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5037">“Shut up!” Kynes croaked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5038">
				“It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5040">
				He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him.
				Water so near&mdash;only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure
				to come, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5041">
				Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression
				his movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but
				the sensation was remote.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5042">
				“The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of
				native life forms,” his father said. “How strange that so few people
				ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal
				nitrogen-oxygen-CO<sub class="calibre7">2</sub> balance being maintained
				here in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The energy sphere of
				the planet is there to see and understand&mdash;a relentless process,
				but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something occupies
				that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after
				they are explained. I knew the little maker was there, deep in the sand,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5045">
				A hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold
				its wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak
				at it. The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5046">
				“Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets

				her own way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5047">
				The hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It
				transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5048">
				Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.

				“The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on
				Arrakis,” his father said. “You cannot go on forever stealing what you
				need without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a
				planet are written into its economic and political record. We have the
				record in front of us and our course is obvious.”

				The hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand, turned its

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5052">
				“Arrakis is a one-crop planet,” his father said. “One crop. It supports
				a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times

				<span

				“The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with

				“Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,” his father
				said. “An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious

				“Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon,” his

				changes will become controlling influences in their own right&mdash;and

				<i class="calibre2">Why aren’t you helping me?</i> Kynes wondered.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me</i

				voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5064">
				Kynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a
				time while its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped
				only a hop away from his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5065">
				A profound clarity filled Kynes’ mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential

				The hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his

				Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5089">
				To Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit
				training, Jessica recognized the speech. It was Chakobsa, one of the
				ancient hunting languages, and the man above them was saying that
				perhaps these were the strangers they sought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5090">
				In the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoopwheel
				face of the second moon&mdash;faintly ivory blue&mdash;rolled over the
				rocks across the basin, bright and peering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5091">
				Scrambling sounds came from the rocks&mdash;above and to both sides…dark
				motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5092">
				<i class="calibre2">A whole troop!</i> Paul thought with a sudden pang.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5093">
				A tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth
				baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the
				sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of
				his hood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5094">
				“What have we here&mdash;jinn or human?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5095">
				When Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a
				faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first
				shocked them with its intrusion from the night.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5096">
				“Human, I warrant,” the man said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5097">
				Jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man’s
				robe. She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no
				shields.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5098">
				“Do you also speak?” the man asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5099">
				Jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5100"

					title="450"></span
				>into her manner and voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard
				enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and
				weaknesses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5101">
				“Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?” she demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5102">
				The burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow
				relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5103">
				Paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give
				each of them a clearer arena of action.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5104">
				The hooded head turned at Paul’s movement, opening a wedge of face to
				moonlight. Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye&mdash;<i
					class="calibre2"
					>dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it</i
				>&mdash;a heavy brown and upturned mustache.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5105">
				“A likely cub,” the man said. “If you’re fugitives from the Harkonnens,
				it may be you’re welcome among us. What is it, boy?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5106">
				The possibilities flashed through Paul’s mind:
				<i class="calibre2">A trick? A fact?</i> Immediate decision was needed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5107">
				“Why should you welcome fugitives?” he demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5108">
				“A child who thinks and speaks like a man,” the tall man said. “Well,
				now, to answer your question, my young wali, I am one who does not pay
				the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might
				welcome a fugitive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5109">
				<i class="calibre2">He knows who we are</i>, Paul thought.
				<i class="calibre2">There’s concealment in his voice</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5110">
				“I am Stilgar, the Fremen,” the tall man said. “Does that speed your
				tongue, boy?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5111">
				<i class="calibre2">It is the same voice</i>, Paul thought. And he
				remembered
				<span

				>the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the
				Harkonnens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5113">
				“I know you, Stilgar,” Paul said. “I was with my father in Council when
				you came for the water of your friend. You took away with you my
				father’s man, Duncan Idaho&mdash;an exchange of friends.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5114">
				“And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5115">
				Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared
				for attack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5116">
				The voice from the rocks above them called: “We waste time here, Stil.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5117">
				“This is the Duke’s son,” Stilgar barked. “He’s certainly the one Liet
				told us to seek.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5118">“But…a child, Stil.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5119">
				“The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper,” Stilgar said. “That
				was a brave crossing he made in the path of
				<i class="calibre2">shai-hulud</i>.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5120">
				And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already
				passed sentence?
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5121">
				“We haven’t time for the test,” the voice above them protested.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5122">
				“Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5123">
				<i class="calibre2">He’s looking for an omen!</i> Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5124">
				“But the woman,” the voice above them said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5125">
				Jessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5126">
				“Yes, the woman,” Stilgar said. “And her water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5127">
				“You know the law,” said the voice from the rocks. “Ones who cannot live

				“Did Liet <i class="calibre2">command</i> this?” asked the voice from

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5131">
				“You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis,” Stilgar said. “Why do you
				press me?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5132">
				And Jessica thought: <i class="calibre2">Cielago!</i> The clue of the
				tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of
				Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant <i class="calibre2">bat</i>, a small
				flying mammal. <i class="calibre2">Voice of the cielago</i>: they had
				received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5133">
				“I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar,” said the voice above
				them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5134">
				“My duty is the strength of the tribe,” Stilgar said. “That is my only
				duty. I need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He
				is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the
				father sun. He has not the eyes of the ibad. Yet he does not speak or
				act like a weakling of the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5135">
				“We cannot stay out here all night arguing,” said the voice from the
				rocks. “If a patrol&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5136">
				“I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5137">
				The man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving,
				crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin
				floor on their left.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5138">
				“The voice of the cielago suggested there’d be value to us in saving you
				two,” Stilgar said. “I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is
				young and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?” He stared at Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5139">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5141">
				“I am the mother of this boy,” Jessica said. “In part, his strength
				which you admire is the product of my training.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5142">
				“The strength of a woman can be boundless,” Stilgar said. “Certain it is
				in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5143">
				For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question,
				answered truthfully, “No.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5144">
				“Are you trained in the ways of the desert?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5145">
				“No, but many consider my training valuable.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5146">
				“We make our own judgments on value,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5147">
				“Every man has the right to his own judgments,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5148">
				“It is well that you see the reason,” Stilgar said. “We cannot dally
				here to test you, woman. Do you understand? We’d not want your shade to
				plague us. I will take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my
				countenance, sanctuary in my tribe. But for you, woman&mdash;you
				understand there is nothing personal in this? It is the rule, Istislah,
				in the general interest. Is that not enough?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5149">
				Paul took a half-step forward. “What are you talking about?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5150">
				Stilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica.
				“Unless you’ve been deep-trained from childhood to live here, you could
				bring destruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot
				carry useless….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5151">
				Jessica’s motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground.
				It was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5152"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="454"></span
				>to do, and the obvious slows an opponent’s reactions. It takes an
				instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as
				something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to
				bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position.
				A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was
				against the rocks with the man helpless in front of her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5153">
				At his mother’s first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked,
				he dove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his path, half-crouched,
				lunging forward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the
				sternum with a straight-hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of
				his neck, relieving him of the weapon as he fell.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5154">
				Then Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the
				weapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized it in spite of its
				unfamiliar shape&mdash;a projectile weapon, and that said many things
				about this place, another clue that shields were not used here.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5155">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5156">
				There came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles
				whined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked his robe. He
				squeezed around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow
				vertical crack, began inching upward&mdash;his back against one side,
				his feet against the other&mdash;slowly, as silently as he could.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5157">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5158"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5159">
				A voice out of the basin said: “The boy got away, Stil. What are
				we&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5160">
				“Of course he got away, you sand-brained…Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5161">
				“Tell them to stop hunting my son,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5162">
				“They’ve stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods
				below! Why didn’t you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5163">
				“Tell your men to fall back,” Jessica said. “Tell them to go out into
				the basin where I can see them…and you’d better believe that I know how
				many of them there are.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5164">
				And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-minded as I
					think him, we have a chance</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5165">
				Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest
				and look down into the basin. Stilgar’s voice came up to him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5166">
				“And if I refuse? How can you…ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no harm
				to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us,
				you’re worth ten times your weight of water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5167">
				<i class="calibre2">Now, the test of reason</i>, Jessica thought. She
				said: “You ask after the Lisan al-Gaib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5168">
				“You could be the folk of the legend,” he said, “but I’ll believe that
				when it’s been tested. All I know now is that you came here with that
				stupid Duke who….
				<span

				>Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave,
				but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5170">Silence.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5171">
				Presently, Jessica said: “He had no choice, but we’ll not argue it. Now,
				tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to
				bring his weapon to bear on me, or I’ll rid the universe of you and take
				him next.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5172">
				“You there!” Stilgar roared. “Do as she says!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5173">“But, Stil&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5174">
				“Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard
				turd! Do it or I’ll help her dismember you! Can’t you see the worth of
				this woman?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5175">
				The man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered
				his weapon.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5176">
				“He has obeyed,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5177">
				“Now,” Jessica said, “explain clearly to your people what it is you wish
				of me. I want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5178">
				“When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend
				with the pan and graben folk,” Stilgar said. “We carry no weapons, for
				the crysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability
				of battle. We’d only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt
				what he sees with his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen.
				<i class="calibre2">This</i> is a weapon no search could expose.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5179">
				There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar’s words sank home.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5180">
				“And if I agree to teach you the…weirding way?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5181">
				“My countenance for you as well as your son.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5182">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5183"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="457"></span
				>“How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5184">
				Stilgar’s voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on
				an edge of bitterness. “Out here, woman, we carry no paper for
				contracts. We make no evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man
				says a thing, that’s the contract. As leader of my people, I’ve put them
				in bond to my word. Teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary
				with us as long as you wish. Your water shall mingle with our water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5185">
				“Can you speak for all Fremen?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5186">
				“In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen.
				Here, I promise only secrecy. My people will not speak of you to any
				other sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your
				Duke is dead. It is said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter
				does not seek dead game.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5187">
				<i class="calibre2">There’s a safety in that</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>But these people have good communications and a message could be
					sent</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5188">
				“I presume there was a reward offered for us,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5189">
				Stilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning
				over in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5190">
				Presently, he said: “I will say it once more: I’ve given the tribe’s
				word-bond. My people know your worth to us now. What could the
				Harkonnens give us? Our freedom? Hah! No, you are the taqwa, that which
				buys us more than all the spice in the Harkonnen coffers.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5191">
				“Then I shall teach you my way of battle,” Jessica said, and she sensed
				the unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5192">
				<span

				>“Now, will you release me?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5194">
				“So be it,” Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in
				full view of the bank in the basin.
				<i class="calibre2">This is the test-mashed</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5195">
				In the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of
				where his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly
				stilled, above him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint
				shadow there outlined against the stars.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5196">
				Stilgar’s voice came up from the basin: “You, up there! Stop hunting the
				boy. He’ll come down presently.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5197">
				The voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above Paul:
				“But, Stil, he can’t be far from&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5198">
				“I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5199">
				There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice:
				“Call <i class="calibre2">me</i> spawn of a lizard!” But the shadow
				pulled back out of view.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5200">
				Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed
				movement of Stilgar beside his mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5201">
				“Come in, all of you,” Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. “And now
				I’ll ask you how <i class="calibre2">we</i> may be certain you’ll

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5202">
				“We of the Bene Gesserit don’t break our vows any more than you do,”
				Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5203">
				There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: “A
				Bene Gesserit witch!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5204">
				Paul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark
				figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile,
				staring at Jessica.

				shrugged.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5208">
				Jessica sighed, thinking:

				She said: “The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the

				prophecy&mdash;this I know. Do you wish a sign?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5210">
				His nostrils flared in the moonlight. “We cannot tarry for the rites,”
				he whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5211">
				Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency
				escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called
				“Sietch Tabr” on the chart and beside it the notation: “Stilgar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5212">
				“Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5213">
				The revelation shook him, and Jessica thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>If only he knew the tricks we use! She must’ve been good, that Bene
					Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully
					prepared to believe in us</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5214">
				Stilgar shifted uneasily. “We must go now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5215">
				She nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5216">
				He looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul
				crouched. “You there, lad: you may come down now.” He returned his
				attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: “Your son made an
				incredible
				<span

				>amount of noise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all,
				but he’s young.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5218">
				“No doubt we have much to teach each other,” Jessica said. “Meanwhile,
				you’d best see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough
				in disarming him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5219">
				Stilgar whirled, his hood flapping. “Where?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5220">
				“Beyond those bushes.” She pointed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5221">
				Stilgar touched two of his men. “See to it.” He glanced at his
				companions, identifying them. “Jamis is missing.” He turned to Jessica.
				“Even your cub knows the weirding way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5222">
				“And you’ll notice that my son hasn’t stirred from up there as you
				ordered,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5223">
				The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled
				and gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned
				his attention to Jessica. “The son will take only your orders, eh? Good.
				He knows discipline.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5224">
				“Paul, you may come down now,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5225">
				Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft,
				slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another
				figure arose from the rocks to face him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5226">
				In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure
				in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and
				the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of
				robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5227">
				“I am Chani, daughter of Liet.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5228">
				The voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5229">
				<span

				>“I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5231">
				Paul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon’s path
				and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that
				face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience,
				shocked Paul to stillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he
				had once described this face-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother
				Gaius Helen Mohiam: “I will meet her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5232">
				And here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5233">
				“You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage,” she said. “And you took the
				most difficult way up here. Follow me; I’ll show you an easier way
				down.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5234">
				He scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across
				a tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks.
				Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5235">
				<i class="calibre2">That girl!</i> She was like a touch of destiny. He
				felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his
				spirits.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5236">
				They stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5237">
				Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: “This will be
				a good exchange of teachings. I hope you and your people feel no anger
				at our violence. It seemed…necessary. You were about to…make a mistake.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5238">
				“To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise,”
				<span

				>Stilgar said. He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon
				from Paul’s waist with the other, tossed it to a companion. “You will
				have your own maula pistol, lad, when you’ve earned it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5240">
				Paul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother’s teaching:
				<i class="calibre2">“Beginnings are such delicate times.”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5241">
				“My son has what weapons he needs,” Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar,
				forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5242">
				Stilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued&mdash;Jamis. The man stood
				at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily. “You are a difficult
				woman,” Stilgar said. He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped
				his fingers. “Kushti bakka te.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5243">
				<i class="calibre2">More Chakobsa</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5244">
				The companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar’s hand. Stilgar
				ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica’s neck beneath
				her hood, fitted the other around Paul’s neck in the same way.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5245">
				“Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka,” he said. “If we become
				separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar’s sietch. We
				will talk of weapons another time.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5246">
				He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul’s
				Fremkit pack to one of his men to carry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5247">
				<i class="calibre2">Bakka</i>, Jessica thought, recognizing the
				religious term: <i class="calibre2">bakka&mdash;the weeper</i>. She
				sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band.
				<i class="calibre2">Why should weeping unite them?</i> she asked
				herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5248">
				Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed
				<span

				>Paul, said: “Chani, take the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of
				trouble.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5250">
				Chani touched Paul’s arm. “Come along, child-man.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5251">
				Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: “My name is Paul. It were well
				you&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5252">
				“We’ll give you a name, manling,” Stilgar said, “in the time of the
				mihna, at the test of aql.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5253">
				<i class="calibre2">The test of reason</i>, Jessica translated. The
				sudden need of Paul’s ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and
				she barked, “My son’s been tested with the gom jabbar!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5254">
				In the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of
				them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5255">
				“There’s much we don’t know of each other,” Stilgar said. “But we tarry
				overlong. Day-sun mustn’t find us in the open.” He crossed to the man
				Paul had struck down, said, “Jamis, can you travel?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5256">
				A grunt answered him. “Surprised me, he did. ’Twas an accident. I can
				travel.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5257">
				“No accident,” Stilgar said. “I’ll hold you responsible with Chani for
				the lad’s safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5258">
				Jessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with
				Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar
				had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5259">
				Stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out.
				“Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no
				trace. Extra care&mdash;we have two with us who’ve not been trained.” He
				turned, hand upheld and aimed across the basin. “In
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5260"

					title="464"></span
				>squad line with flankers&mdash;move out. We must be at Cave of the
				Ridges before dawn.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5261">
				Jessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty
				Fremen&mdash;she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They travel as a military company&mdash;even the girl, Chani</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5262">
				Paul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black
				feeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory
				called up by his mother’s barked reminder: “My son’s been tested with
				the gom jabbar!” He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5263">
				“Watch where you go,” Chani hissed. “Do not brush against a bush lest
				you leave a thread to show our passage.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5264">Paul swallowed, nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5265">
				Jessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps
				and Paul’s, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty
				people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the
				place&mdash;ghostly feluccas, their robes flitting through the shadows.
				Their destination was Sietch Tabr&mdash;Stilgar’s sietch.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5266">
				She turned the word over in her mind: sietch. It was a Chakobsa word,
				unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries.
				Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of
				the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after
				the tension of their encounter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5267">
				“We move well,” Stilgar said. “With Shai-hulud’s favor, we’ll reach Cave
				of the Ridges before dawn.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5268">
				Jessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue

				<span

					id="calibre_link-5269"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="465"></span
				>she admitted it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5270">
				<i class="calibre2">All of them</i>, she thought,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5276">
				Paul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this
				planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward
				gray-blue sky.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5277">
				Chani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: “Quickly. It is already

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5278">
				“The men who climbed above us, where are they going?” Paul whispered.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5279">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5280">

				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5282">“Faster,” Chani whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5283">
				Paul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought
				of the words of the sirat from Yueh’s tiny O.C. Bible.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5284">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“Paradise on my right, Hell on my left, and the Angel of Death

				He rolled the quotation in his mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5285">
				They rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one
				side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5286">
				“Quickly!” he hissed. “We’re like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches
				us here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5287">
				Paul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by
				thin gray light from somewhere ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5288">“You can stand up,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5289">
				He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed
				ceiling that curved away just out of a man’s handreach. The troop spread
				out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her
				examine their companions. And he noted how she failed to blend with the
				Fremen even though her garb was identical. The way she moved&mdash;such
				a sense of power and grace.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5290">
				“Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child-man,” Chani said.
				“Here’s food.” She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels into his hand. They
				reeked of spice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5291">
				Stilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left.
				“Get the doorseal in place and see to
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5292"

					title="468"></span
				>moisture security.” He turned to another Fremen: “Lemil, get
				glowglobes.” He took Jessica’s arm. “I wish to show you something,
				weirding woman.” He led her around a curve of rock toward the light
				source.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5293">
				Jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening
				to the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall&mdash;looking out across
				another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was
				shielded by high rock walls. Sparse clumps of plant growth were
				scattered around it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5294">
				As she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far
				escarpment illuminating a biscuit-colored landscape of rocks and sand.
				And she noted how the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5295">
				<i class="calibre2">It’s because we want to hold it back</i>, she
				thought. <i class="calibre2">Night is safer than day</i>. There came

				rain. <i class="calibre2">I must suppress such longings</i>, she
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They’re a weakness. I no longer can afford weaknesses</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5296">
				Stilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. “There! There you see
				proper Druses.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5297">
				She looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor
				scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliff wall.
				In spite of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air.
				She lifted her binoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses
				on the distant people. Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored
				butterflies.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5298">
				“That is home,” Stilgar said. “We will be there this night.” He stared
				across the basin, tugging at his mustache.
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5300">
				“Your people show good discipline,” Jessica said. She lowered the
				binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5301">
				“They obey the preservation of the tribe,” he said. “It is the way we
				choose among us for a leader. The leader is the one who is strongest,
				the one who brings water and security.” He lifted his attention to her
				face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5302">
				She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits,
				the dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving
				down from his nostrils into his stillsuit.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5303">
				“Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5304">
				“You did not call me out,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5305">
				“It’s important that a leader keep the respect of his troop,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5306">
				“Isn’t a one of those sandlice I cannot handle,” Stilgar said. “When you
				bested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn from you…the
				weirding way…and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5307">
				She weighed the implications. “By besting you in formal battle?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5308">
				He nodded. “I’d advise you against this because they’d not follow you.
				You’re not of the sand. They saw this in our night’s passage.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5309">“Practical people,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5310">
				“True enough.” He glanced at the basin. “We know
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5311"

					title="470"></span
				>our needs. But not many are thinking deep thoughts now this close to
				home. We’ve been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to
				the free traders for the cursed Guild…may their faces be forever black.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5312">
				Jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into
				his face. “The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your spice?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5313">
				“It’s Liet’s command,” Stilgar said. “We know the reason, but the taste
				of it sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to
				keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do
				to the face of Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5314">
				She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be
				the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. “And what is it you
				do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5315">
				“We change it…slowly but with certainty…to make it fit for human life.
				Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our children’s
				children nor the grandchildren of their children…but it will come.” He
				stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. “Open water and tall green
				plants and people walking freely without stillsuits.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5316">
				<i class="calibre2">So that’s the dream of this Liet-Kynes</i>, she
				thought. And she said: “Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing
				larger and larger.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5317">
				“They grow,” he said, “but the slow way is the safe way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5318">
				Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way
				Stilgar was seeing it in his imagination. She saw only the grayed
				mustard stain of distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above
				the cliffs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5319">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5321">
				She thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a
				mirage&mdash;another landscape hovering over the desert-sand and a
				distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm
				traveling the surface with what looked like Fremen robes fluttering on
				its back.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5322">The mirage faded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5323">
				“It would be better to ride,” Stilgar said, “but we cannot permit a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5324">

				She measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not
				<i class="calibre2">permit</i> a worm into this basin. She knew what she

				“We must be getting back to the others,” Stilgar said. “Else my people

				“That will be enough of that!” Jessica snapped.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5328">

				Jessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard
				in Stilgar’s voice&mdash;the unspoken offer of more than his
				<i class="calibre2">countenance</i>. Did he need a wife? She realized
				she could step into that place with him. It would be one way to end
				conflict over tribal leadership&mdash;female properly aligned with male.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5334">
				But what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood
				prevailed here? And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these
				few weeks? What of a dead Duke’s daughter? And she permitted herself to
				face fully the significance of this other child growing within her, to
				see her own motives in permitting the conception. She knew what it
				was&mdash;she had succumbed to that profound drive shared by all
				creatures who are faced with death&mdash;the drive to seek immortality
				through progeny. The fertility drive of the species had overpowered
				them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5335">
				Jessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5336">
				Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of
				the questions in her mind. “What is important for a leader is that which
				makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your
				powers, there may come a day when one of us must challenge the other. I
				would prefer some alternative.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5337">

				Before she could probe this, he said: “I do not necessarily offer myself

				But should you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young

				“There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild

				if it can be avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things

				individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5344">
				His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much

				Stilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to
				carry to the crowd’s fringe. “Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina.
				Your son bested him and&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5437">
				“It was an accident!” Jamis roared. “There was witch-force at Tuono
				Basin and I’ll prove it now!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5438">
				“…and I’ve bested him myself,” Stilgar continued. “He seeks by this
				tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There’s too much of
				violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader&mdash;too much
				ghafla, the distraction. He gives his mouth to the rules and his heart
				to the sarfa, the turning away. No, he could never make a good leader.
				I’ve preserved him this long because he’s useful in a fight as such, but
				when he gets this carving anger on him he’s dangerous to his own
				society.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5439">
				“Stilgar-r-r-r!” Jamis rumbled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5440">
				And Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take
				the challenge away from Paul.

				rumbling voice. “Jamis, he’s but a boy. He’s&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5443">
				“You named him a man,” Jamis said. “His mother
				<i class="calibre2">says</i> he’s been through the gom jabbar. He’s
				full-fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried their
				pack say there’s literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our
				catchpockets the instant they show dewsparkle.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5444">
				Stilgar glanced at Jessica. “Is this true? Is there water in your pack?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5445">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5446">“Literjons of it?”</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5448">
				“What was intended with this wealth?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5449">
				<i class="calibre2">Wealth?</i> she thought. She shook her head, feeling
				the coldness in his voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5450">
				“Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide
				rivers,” she said. “There were oceans of it so broad you could not see
				the other shore. I’ve not been trained to your water discipline. I never
				before had to think of it this way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5451">
				A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: “Water fell from the
				sky…it ran <i class="calibre2">over</i> the land.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5452">
				“Did you know there’re those among us who’ve lost from their

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5453">
				“How could I know?” Jessica shook her head. “If they’re in need, give

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5454">
				“Is that what you intended with this wealth?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5455">
				“I intended it to save life,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5456">
				“Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5457">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5459">
				Stilgar faced Jamis. “Are you determined to press this fight against a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5460">“She must be championed.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5461">
				“Even though she has my countenance?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5462">
				“I invoke the amtal rule,” Jamis said. “It’s my right.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5463">
				Stilgar nodded. “Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you’ll answer
				to my knife afterward. And this time I’ll not hold back the blade as
				I’ve done before.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5464">
				“You cannot do this thing,” Jessica said. “Paul’s just&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5465">
				“You must not interfere, Sayyadina,” Stilgar said. “Oh, I know you can
				take me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us
				all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5466">
				Jessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the
				glowglobes, seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his
				expression. She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to
				his brows and thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I should’ve seen that before. He broods. He’s the silent kind, one
					who works himself up inside. I should’ve been prepared.</i

			</p>

				“If you harm my son,” she said, “you’ll have me to meet. I call you out

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5468">
				“Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. “Perhaps if I

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5469">“Explain!” Jamis sneered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5470">
				Paul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis
				appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their
				night encounter on the sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of
				this cave, still remembered
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5471"

				>the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5472">
				Stilgar said: “Sayyadina, you must step back now where&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5473">
				“Stop calling her Sayyadina!” Jamis said. “That’s yet to be proved. So

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5474">
				<i class="calibre2">He has talked enough</i>, Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’ve the key to him. I could immobilize him with a word.</i

				She hesitated. <i class="calibre2">But I cannot stop them all.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5475">
				“You will answer to me then,” Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in
				a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5476">
				Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5477">
				“I’ll teach you agony,” she said in the same tone. “Remember

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5478">
				“She tries a spell on me!” Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist
				beside his ear. “I invoke the silence on her!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5479">
				“So be it then,” Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. “If
				you speak again, Sayyadina, we’ll know it’s your witchcraft and you’ll
				be forfeit.” He nodded for her to step back.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5480">
				Jessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they
				were not unkindly. She saw Paul being separated from the throng, the
				elfin-faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.
			</p>

				>A ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of
				them tuned to the yellow band.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5483">
				Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to
				someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of
				stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a
				moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder, drinking from a
				catchpocket tube. Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the
				suit, handed it carefully into the crowd. He stood waiting, clad in
				loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right
				hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5484">
				Jessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife
				handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance.
				And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu,
				the nerve and the fiber&mdash;that he had been taught fighting in a
				deadly school, his teachers men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck,
				men who were legends in their own lifetimes. The boy knew the devious
				ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5485">
				<i class="calibre2">But he’s only fifteen</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>And he has no shield. I must stop this. Somehow, there must be a way

				>
				She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5486">
				“You cannot stop it,” he said. “You must not speak.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5487">
				She put a hand over her mouth, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’ve planted fear in Jamis’ mind. It’ll slow him some…perhaps. If I
					could only pray&mdash;truly pray.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5488">
				Paul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks
				he’d worn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in his right hand;
				his feet were bare against the
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5489"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="488"></span
				>sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“When in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best.”</i
				>
				And there were Chani’s words of instruction still in the front of his
				consciousness:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry. It’s a habit
					in him we’ve all seen. And he’ll aim for the eyes to catch a blink in
					which to slash you. And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife
					shift.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5490">
				But strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was
				training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered
				into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5491">
				Gurney Halleck’s words were there to remember:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard
					simultaneously. The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the
					shearing-guard can also trap your opponent’s blade.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5492">
				Paul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the
				slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand.
				And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of
				this blade, did not even know if it <i class="calibre2">could</i> be
				broken.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5493">
				Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite
				Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5494">
				Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to
				fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense
				with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled
				slowness necessary for penetrating the enemy’s shield. In spite of
				constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shield’s
				mindless blunting of attack speed, he knew that shield-awareness was
				part of him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5495">
				<span

				>Jamis called out in ritual challenge: “May thy knife chip and shatter!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5497">
				<i class="calibre2">This knife will break then</i>, Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5498">
				He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man
				wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5499">
				Paul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man’s body looked like knotted
				whipcord on a dried skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the
				light of the glowglobes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5500">
				Fear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in
				dull yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his
				knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents
				of the future and the strings of decision that guided them, but this was
				the <i class="calibre2">real-now.</i> This was death hanging on an
				infinite number of minuscule mischances.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5501">
				Anything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the
				troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe’s
				brilliance, a deceptive shadow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5502">
				<i class="calibre2">I’m afraid</i>, Paul told himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5503">
				And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating silently to himself the
				Bene Gesserit litany against fear.
				<i class="calibre2">“Fear is the mind-killer….”</i> It was a cool bath
				washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and
				ready.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5504">
				“I’ll sheath my knife in your blood,” Jamis snarled. And in the middle
				of the last word he pounced.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5505">
				Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5506">
				Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind
				Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5507">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5508"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="490"></span
				><i class="calibre2">Now, Paul! Now!</i> Jessica screamed it in her
				mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5509">
				Paul’s motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave
				Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5510">
				Paul withdrew, crouching low. “First, you must find my blood,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5511">
				Jessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came
				over her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy’s reactions were those
				of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the
				attack was trained, too, and conditioned by the necessities of
				penetrating a shield barrier. A shield would repel too fast a blow,
				admit only the slowly deceptive counter. It needed control and trickery
				to get through a shield.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5512">
				<i class="calibre2">Does Paul see it?</i> she asked herself.
				<i class="calibre2">He must!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5513">
				Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur
				under the glowglobes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5514">
				And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5515">And again.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5516">And again.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5517">
				Each time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5518">
				And Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul’s defensive
				reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the
				precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect
				part of Jamis’ blow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5519">
				“Is your son playing with that poor fool?” Stilgar asked. He waved her
				to silence before she could respond. “Sorry; you must remain silent.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5520">
				Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5521"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="491"></span
				>other: Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly;
				Paul crouched with knife held low.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5522">
				Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul
				had been dodging.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5523">
				Instead of faking back and out, Paul met the man’s knife hand on the
				point of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left
				and thankful for Chani’s warning.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5524">
				Jamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand.
				Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide
				and staring&mdash;two blue-black holes&mdash;studying Paul with a new
				wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5525">
				“Ah, that one hurt,” Stilgar murmured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5526">
				Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first
				blood, called out: “Do you yield?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5527">“Hah!” Jamis cried.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5528">
				An angry murmur arose from the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5529">
				“Hold!” Stilgar called out. “The lad doesn’t know our rule.” Then, to
				Paul: “There can be no yielding in the tahaddi challenge. Death is the
				test of it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5530">
				Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He’s never killed a man like this…in the hot blood of a knife fight.
					Can he do it?</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5531">
				Paul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis’ movement. The prescient
				knowledge of the time-boiling variables in this cave came back to plague
				him now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly
				compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show
				itself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5532">
				Variable piled on variable&mdash;that was why this cave
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5533"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="492"></span
				>lay as a blurred nexus in his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the
				flood, creating maelstroms in the current around it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5534">
				“Have an end to it, lad,” Stilgar muttered. “Don’t play with him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5535">
				Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5536">
				Jamis backed now that the realization swept over him&mdash;that this was
				no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen
				crysknife.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5537">
				Jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man’s face.
				<i class="calibre2">Now is when he’s most dangerous,</i> she thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Now he’s desperate and can do anything. He sees that this is not like
					a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to
					it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5538">
				And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis&mdash;an emotion
				tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5539">
				<i class="calibre2">Jamis could do anything…any unpredictable thing</i>,
				she told herself. She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if
				he were reliving this experience. But she saw the way her son moved, the
				beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness
				visible in the flow of muscles. And for the first time she sensed,
				without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul’s gift.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5540">
				Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the
				fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho’s voice flowed through
				Paul’s awareness:
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5541"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="493"></span
				><i class="calibre2"
					>“When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when you give the
					fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become
					terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in
					desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man
					can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained
					here to detect these mistakes and use them.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5542">
				The crowd in the cavern began to mutter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5543">
				<i class="calibre2">They think Paul’s toying with Jamis,</i> Jessica
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2">They think Paul’s being needlessly cruel.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5544">
				But she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their
				enjoyment of the spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up
				in Jamis. The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as
				apparent to her as it was to Jamis…or to Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5545">
				Jamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but
				the hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5546">Jessica gasped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5547">
				But Paul had been warned by Chani:
				<i class="calibre2">“Jamis fights with either hand.”</i> And the depth
				of his training had taken in that trick
				<i class="calibre2"
					>en passant. “Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that
					holds it,”</i
				>
				Gurney Halleck had told him time and again.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in
					either hand.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5548">
				And Paul had seen Jamis’ mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a
				heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to

				>the inky eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the
				practice floor. Shields didn’t count where the body’s own movement could
				be used against it. Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion,
				slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis’ chest was
				descending&mdash;then away to watch the man crumble.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5551">
				Jamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face
				toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out
				like beads of dark glass.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5552">
				<i class="calibre2">“Killing with the point lacks artistry,”</i> Idaho

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5553">
				The troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid
				Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them
				hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in
				a robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5554">
				And there was no body on the rock floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5555">
				Jessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea
				of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5556">
				<i class="calibre2">Now is the terrible moment,</i> she thought.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5558">
				Jessica stared at her son. Paul’s eyes were bright. He breathed heavily,
				permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5559">
				“Him against Jamis and not a mark on him,” one of the men muttered.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5562">
				<i class="calibre2">It must be done now and swiftly,</i> Jessica
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5563">
				She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said:
				“Well-l-l, now&mdash;how does it feel to be a killer?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5564">
				Paul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother’s cold
				glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he
				glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5565">
				Stilgar pressed through to Jessica’s side, returning from the cave
				depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a
				bitter, controlled tone: “When the time comes for you to call me out and
				try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played
				with Jamis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5566">
				Jessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar’s sank into Paul, doing
				their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made&mdash;it
				served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was
				doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes, and fear…and in
				some&mdash;loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how
				the fight had seemed to him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5567">
				Paul looked at his mother. “You know what it was,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5568">
				She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept
				her glance across the troop, said: “Paul has never before killed a man
				with a naked blade.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5569">
				Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5570">
				“I wasn’t playing with him,” Paul said. He pressed in front of his
				mother, straightening his robe, glanced at
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5571"

					title="496"></span
				>the dark place of Jamis’ blood on the cavern floor. “I did not want to
				kill him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5572">
				Jessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he
				tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering
				awareness spread through the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5573">
				“That’s why y’ asked him to yield,” Stilgar said. “I see. Our ways are
				different, but you’ll see the sense in them. I thought we’d admitted a
				scorpion into our midst.” He hesitated, then: “And I shall not call you
				lad the more.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5574">
				A voice from the troop called out: “Needs a naming, Stil.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5575">
				Stilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. “I see strength in you…like the
				strength beneath a pillar.” Again he paused, then: “You shall be known
				among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your
				troop name. We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so
				presume…Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5576">
				Murmuring went through the troop: “Good choice, that…strong…bring us
				luck.” And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it
				with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5577">
				“Now, what name of manhood do <i class="calibre2">you</i> choose for us
				to call you openly?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5578">
				Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this
				moment registered on his prescient <i class="calibre2">memory</i>, but
				he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing
				him through the narrow door of the present.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5579">
				“How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?” Paul
				asked, remembering the

				><i class="calibre2">pop-hop</i> of motion at Tuono Basin. He
				illustrated with one hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5581">
				A chuckle sounded through the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5582">
				“We call that one muad’dib,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5583">
				Jessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the
				Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear
				<i class="calibre2">of</i> her son and <i class="calibre2">for</i> him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5584">
				Paul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over
				countless times in his mind…yet…there were differences. He could see
				himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and
				possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was
				abyss.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5585">
				And again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the
				green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the
				universe in the name of their prophet Muad’Dib.
				<i class="calibre2">That must not happen,</i> he told himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5586">
				“Is that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5587">
				“I am an Atreides,” Paul whispered, and then louder: “It’s not right
				that I give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could I be known
				among you as Paul-Muad’Dib?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5588">
				“You are Paul-Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5589">
				And Paul thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5590">
				But he felt that the abyss remained all around him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5591">
				Again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man:
				“Wisdom with strength…Couldn’t ask more…It’s the legend for sure…Lisan
				al-Gaib…Lisan al-Gaib….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5592">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5593"

					title="498"></span
				>“I will tell you a thing about your new name,” Stilgar said. “The
				choice pleases us. Muad’Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad’Dib
				creates his own water. Muad’Dib hides from the sun and travels in the
				cool night. Muad’Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad’Dib
				we call ‘instructor-of-boys.’ That is a powerful base on which to build
				your life, Paul-Muad’Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5594">
				Stilgar touched Paul’s forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand,
				embraced Paul and murmured, “Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5595">
				As Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul,
				repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to
				embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone:
				“Usul…Usul…Usul.” Already, he could place some of them by name. And
				there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and
				said his name.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5596">
				Presently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: “Now, you are of
				the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.” His face hardened, and he spoke with
				command in his voice. “And now, Paul-Muad’Dib, tighten up that
				stillsuit.” He glanced at Chani. “Chani! Paul-Muad’Dib’s nose plugs are
				as poor a fit I’ve ever seen! I thought I ordered you to see after him!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5597">
				“I hadn’t the makings, Stil,” she said. “There’s Jamis’, of course,
				but&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5598">“Enough of that!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5599">
				“Then I’ll share one of mine,” she said. “I can make do with one
				until&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5600">
				“You will not,” Stilgar said. “I know there are spares
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5601"

					title="499"></span
				>among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of
				savages?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5602">
				Hands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar
				selected four, handed them to Chani. “Fit these to Usul and the
				Sayyadina.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5603">
				A voice lifted from the back of the troop: “What of the water, Stil?
				What of the literjons in their pack?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5604">
				“I know your need, Farok,” Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She
				nodded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5605">
				“Broach one for those that need it,” Stilgar said. “Watermaster…where is
				a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed.
				The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the
				Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack
				fees.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5606">
				“What is the repayment at field rates?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5607">“Ten for one,” Stilgar said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5608">“But&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5609">
				“It’s a wise rule as you’ll come to see,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5610">
				A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men
				turned to get the water.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5611">
				Stilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. “As to Jamis,” he said,
				“I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the
				Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due
				one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi challenge. I invoke the
				rite…at sunset when the dark shall cover him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5612">
				Paul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into

				The great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s opening.
				She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in
				front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving

				had&mdash;the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air’s
				moisture.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5621">
				How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5629">Thirst.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5630">
				She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over
				rocks…and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her
				robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5640">
				Paul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5641">
				“Mother, do you know what they’re doing back there?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5642">
				Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood.
				“I think so.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5643">
				“Chani showed me…because I’m supposed to see it and give my…permission
				for the weighing of the water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5644">Jessica looked at Chani.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5645">
				“They’re recovering Jamis’ water,” Chani said, and her thin voice came
				out nasal past the nose plugs. “It’s the rule. The flesh belongs to the
				person, but his water belongs to the tribe…except in the combat.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5646">
				“They say the water’s mine,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5647">
				Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5648">
				“Combat water belongs to the winner,” Chani said. “It’s because you have
				to fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water
				back that he loses while fighting.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5649">
				“I don’t want his water,” Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of
				many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was
				disconcerting to the inner eye. He could not be certain what he would
				do, but of one thing he was positive: he did not want the water
				distilled out of Jamis’ flesh.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5652">
				Jessica marveled at the way she said it.
				<i class="calibre2">“Water.”</i> So much meaning in a simple sound. A
				Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica’s mind:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.”</i
				>
				And Jessica thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange
					waters…if we’re to survive.</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5653">
				“You will accept the water,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5654">
				She recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once
				with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum
				offered for his support in a questionable venture&mdash;because money
				maintained power for the Atreides.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5655">
				On Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5656">
				Paul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she
				ordered&mdash;not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice
				had forced him to reevaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with
				accepted Fremen practice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5657">
				Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh’s O.C. Bible. He
				said: “From water does all life begin.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5658">
				Jessica stared at him.

				For no reason she could explain (and

				The voice was Stilgar’s ringing in the cavern. “Jamis’ weapon has been
				killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained
				the phases for the moons that daily wane and&mdash;in the
				end&mdash;appear as bent and withered twigs.” Stilgar’s voice lowered.
				“Thus it is with Jamis.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5664">
				Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5665">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5666">
				“The friends of Jamis will approach,” Stilgar said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5667">
				Men moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A
				single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow
				glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the
				rustling of the robes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5668">
				Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5669">
				Jessica bent close to Paul’s ear, speaking in the family code: “Follow
				their lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the
				shade of Jamis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5670">
				<i class="calibre2">It will be more than that,</i> Paul thought. And he
				felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying
				to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5671">
				Chani glided back to Jessica’s side, took her hand. “Come, Sayyadina. We
				must sit apart.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5672">
				Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt
				abandoned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5673">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5674"

				>The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5675">“Come, Usul.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5676">
				He allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of
				people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and
				beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on
				the rock floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5677">
				The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing
				with the movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the
				way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of
				green fabric at his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered
				mound at Stilgar’s feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding
				from the fabric.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5678">
				“The spirit leaves the body’s water when the first moon rises,” Stilgar
				intoned. “Thus it is spoken. When we see the first moon rise this night,
				whom will it summon?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5679">“Jamis,” the troop responded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5680">
				Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring
				of faces. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the hawk plane
				stooped upon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5681">
				He bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. “I take this
				robe as a friend of Jamis&mdash;leader’s right.” He draped the robe over
				a shoulder, straightening.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5682">
				Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening
				gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book
				in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a
				folded pack, a paracompass,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5683"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="507"></span
				>a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an
				assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a
				clump of bundled feathers…and the baliset exposed beside the folded
				pack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5684">
				<i class="calibre2">So Jamis played the baliset</i>, Paul thought. The
				instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul
				knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chance-lines
				could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and
				shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched him with
				wonder.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Does it mean that something I will do…that I may do, could destroy
					Gurney…or bring him back to life…or….</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5685">
				Paul swallowed, shook his head.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5686">
				Again, Stilgar bent over the mound.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5687">
				“For Jamis’ woman and for the guards,” he said. The small rocks and the
				book were taken into the folds of his robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5688">
				“Leader’s right,” the troop intoned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5689">
				“The marker for Jamis’ coffee service,” Stilgar said, and he lifted a
				flat disc of green metal. “That it shall be given to Usul in suitable
				ceremony when we return to the sietch.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5690">
				“Leader’s right,” the troop intoned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5691">
				Lastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it. “For the Funeral
				Plain,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5692">
				“For the Funeral Plain,” the troop responded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5693">
				At her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing
				the ancient source of the rite, and she thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The meeting between ignorance and knowledge,
					<span
						type="pagebreak"
						id="calibre_link-5694"
						role="doc-pagebreak"
						title="508"></span
					>between brutality and culture&mdash;it begins in the dignity with
					which we treat our dead.</i
				>
				She looked across at Paul, wondering:
				<i class="calibre2">Will he see it? Will he know what to do?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5695">
				“We are friends of Jamis,” Stilgar said. “We are not wailing for our
				dead like a pack of garvarg.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5696">
				A gray-bearded man to Paul’s left stood up. “I was a friend of Jamis,”
				he said. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. “When our water
				went below minim at the siege at Two Brids, Jamis shared.” The man
				returned to his place in the circle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5697">
				<i class="calibre2">Am I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis?</i>
				Paul wondered.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Do they expect me to take something from that pile?</i
				>
				He saw faces turn toward him, turn away.
				<i class="calibre2">They do expect it!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5698">
				Another man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the
				paracompass. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the patrol caught
				us at Bight-of-the-Cliff and I was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the
				wounded could be saved.” He returned to his place in the circle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5699">
				Again, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them,
				lowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: “Would you
				bring the destruction on us?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5700">
				<i class="calibre2">How can I say I was his friend?</i> Paul wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5701">
				Another figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded
				face came into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a
				kerchief from the mount. “I was a friend of Jamis,” she said. “When the
				spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth, that spirit
				withdrew and spared my son.” She returned to her place.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5702">
				And Paul recalled the scorn in his mother’s voice as
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5703"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="509"></span
				>she had confronted him after the fight.
				<i class="calibre2">“How does it feel to be a killer?”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5704">
				Again, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in
				the troop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on “The Cult
				of the Dead” flickered through Paul’s mind. He knew what he had to do.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5705">Slowly, Paul got to his feet.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5706">
				A sigh passed around the circle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5707">
				Paul felt the diminishment of his <i class="calibre2">self</i> as he
				advanced into the center of the circle. It was as though he lost a
				fragment of himself and sought it here. He bent over the mound of
				belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged softly as it struck
				against something in the pile.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5708">
				“I was a friend of Jamis,” Paul whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5709">
				He felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice.
				“Jamis taught me…that…when you kill…you pay for it. I wish I’d known
				Jamis better.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5710">
				Blindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the
				rock floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5711">
				A voice hissed: “He sheds tears!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5712">
				It was taken up around the ring: “Usul gives moisture to the dead!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5713">
				He felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5714">
				Jessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized
				what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She
				focused on the words:
				<i class="calibre2">“He gives moisture to the dead.”</i> It was a gift
				to the shadow world&mdash;tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5715">
				Nothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate
				value of water. Not the water-sellers,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5716"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="510"></span
				>not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of
				water discipline. Here there was a substance more precious than all
				others&mdash;it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism
				and ritual.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5717">Water.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5718">
				“I touched his cheek,” someone whispered. “I felt the gift.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5719">
				At first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the
				cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he
				saw the faces beyond the groping hands&mdash;the eyes wide and
				wondering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5720">
				Presently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now
				there was a subtle space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop
				honored him by a respectful isolation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5721">
				The ceremony ended with a low chant:
			</p>
			<div class="block1" id="calibre_link-5722">
				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-5723">
					“Full moon calls thee&mdash;

				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-5726">

				<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-5727">

				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5731">
				A bulging sack remained at Stilgar’s feet. He crouched, placed his palms
				against it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul
				recognized Chani’s face in the hood shadow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5732">
				“Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds
				<span

				>drachms of the tribe’s water,” Chani said. “I bless it now in the
				presence of a Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water,
				fillissin-follasy of Paul-Muad’Dib! Kivi a-kavi, never the more,
				nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted, ukair-an! by the
				heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend…Jamis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5734">
				In an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul.
				Presently she said: “Where I am flame be thou the coals. Where I am dew
				be thou the water.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5735">
				“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5736">
				“To Paul-Muad’Dib goes this portion,” Chani said. “May he guard it for
				the tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with
				it in time of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the
				tribe.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5737">
				“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5738">
				<i class="calibre2">I must accept that water</i>, Paul thought. Slowly,
				he arose, made his way to Chani’s side. Stilgar stepped back to make
				room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5739">“Kneel,” Chani said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5740">Paul knelt.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5741">
				She guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient
				surface. “With this water the tribe entrusts thee,” she said. “Jamis is
				gone from it. Take it in peace.” She stood, pulling Paul up with her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5742">
				Stilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in
				one palm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the
				light of the glowglobe reflected off them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5743">
				Chani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. “Thirty liters,” she
				said. One by one, she took the others, showing
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5744"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="512"></span
				>each to Paul, counting them. “Two liters; one liter; seven
				watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of
				three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all&mdash;thirty-three liters and seven
				and three-thirty-seconds drachms.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5745">
				She held them up on her finger for Paul to see.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5746">
				“Do you accept them?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5747">
				Paul swallowed, nodded. “Yes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5748">
				“Later,” Chani said, “I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so
				they won’t rattle and give you away when you need silence.” She extended
				her hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5749">
				“Will you…hold them for me?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5750">
				Chani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5751">
				He smiled, said, “Paul-Muad’Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways,
				Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it’s time to show
				him the manner of carrying them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5752">
				She nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the
				rings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then
				stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5753">
				<i class="calibre2">I missed something there,</i> Paul thought. He
				sensed the feeling of humor around him, something bantering in it, and
				his mind linked up a prescient memory:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>watercounters offered to a woman&mdash;courtship ritual.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5754">“Watermasters,” Stilgar said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5755">
				The troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the
				waterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the
				depths of the cave.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5756">
				Paul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over
				rock walls, the way the shadows
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5757"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="513"></span
				>danced, and he felt the troop’s lift of spirits contained in a hushed
				air of expectancy.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5758">
				Jessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around
				by jostling bodies, suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized
				fragments of the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani
				Jib in the words, and she knew the wild violence that could explode out
				of these seemingly simple moments.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5759">
				<i class="calibre2">Jan-jan-jan</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Go-go-go.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5760">
				It was like a child’s game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5761">
				Stilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the
				wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He
				led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool
				wash of air across Paul when he passed it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5762">
				Paul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. “That air felt
				damp,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5763">“Sh-h-h-h,” she whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5764">
				But a man behind them said: “Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight.
				Jamis’ way of telling us he’s satisfied.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5765">
				Jessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw
				how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the
				dampness of the air as she came opposite it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5766">
				<i class="calibre2">Windtrap!</i> she thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They’ve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air
					down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5767">
				They passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the
				door closed behind them. The
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5768"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="514"></span
				>draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly
				perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5769">
				At the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar’s hands dropped below
				the level of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath
				his feet, curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across
				hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5770">
				Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of
				silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5771">
				The steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light
				of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved
				ceiling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5772">
				Paul felt Chani’s hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the
				chill air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral
				presence of water.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5773">
				<i class="calibre2">I have seen this place in a dream,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5774">
				The thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him
				on this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe
				in his name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol
				of terror. Wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war
				cry: “Muad’Dib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5775">
				<i class="calibre2">It must not be</i>, he thought.
				<i class="calibre2">I cannot let it happen.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5776">
				But he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own
				terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the
				juggernaut. It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this
				instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn
				<span

				>sister. Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and
				now&mdash;himself and his mother included&mdash;could stop the thing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5778">
				Paul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed
				him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the
				barrier in the glow of Stilgar’s globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark
				surface of water. It stretched away into shadows&mdash;deep and
				black&mdash;the far wall only faintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters
				away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5779">
				Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing
				in the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense
				its deepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5780">
				A splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of
				Fremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters
				emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a
				round gray eye above the pool’s rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as
				the water flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty-three
				liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5781">
				<i class="calibre2">Superb accuracy in water measurement,</i> Jessica
				thought. And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace
				of moisture after the water’s passage. The water flowed off those walls
				without binding tension. She saw a profound clue to Fremen technology in
				the simple fact: they were perfectionists.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5782">
				Jessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar’s side. Way was made
				for her with casual courtesy. She
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5783"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="516"></span
				>noted the withdrawn look in Paul’s eyes, but the mystery of this great
				pool of water dominated her thoughts.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5784">
				Stilgar looked at her. “There were those among us in need of water,” he
				said, “yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know
				that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5785">“I believe it,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5786">
				He looked at the pool. “We have more than thirty-eight million
				decaliters here,” he said. “Walled off from the little makers, hidden

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5788">
				Stilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. “It is greater than
				treasure. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them
				all.” He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow-shadowed
				glow across face and beard. “Hear that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5789">They listened.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5790">
				The dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room
				with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a
				rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5791">
				To Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5792">
				“It has been calculated with precision,” Stilgar whispered. “We know to

				“Bi-lal kaifa,” intoned the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5797">
				“Each year the polar ice retreats,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5798">“Bi-lal kaifa,” they chanted.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5799">
				“We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis&mdash;with melting lenses at the

				Her thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor’s planetary ecologist,

				was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed:
				people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and

				Whispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back
				along the water barrier and up the stairs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5808">
				And Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him,
				that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his
				own myth. He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a
				fragment of prescient dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place
				were being filled in now that he had not seen. He felt a new sense of
				wonder at the limits of his gift. It was as though he rode within the
				wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on a crest&mdash;and
				all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then
				hiding what they bore on their surface.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5809">
				Through it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence
				and the slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5810">
				The troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was
				sealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern
				openings, revealing the night and the stars that had come over the
				desert.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5811">
				Jessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern’s edge, looked up at the
				stars. They were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop
				around her, heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind
				her, and Paul’s voice humming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his
				tone that she did not like.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5812">
				Chani’s voice intruded from the deep cave darkness:

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5815">
				<i class="calibre2">Such sadness.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5816">
				“It’s a good baliset,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5817">
				“Very good,” Paul said. “Do you think Jamis’ll mind my using it?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5818">
				<i class="calibre2">He speaks of the dead in the present tense,</i>

				A man’s voice intruded: “He liked music betimes, Jamis did.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5820">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5821">

				now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5823">
				The troop grew still, listening as Paul’s voice lifted in a sweet boy

				<span class="dropcaps">O</span>n his seventeenth birthday, Feyd-Rautha
				Harkonnen killed his one hundredth slave-gladiator in the family games.
				Visiting observers from the Imperial Court&mdash;a Count and Lady
				Fenring&mdash;were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for the
				event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the
				golden box above the triangular arena.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5847">
				In honor of the na-Baron’s nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and
				subjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi
				Prime. The old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from
				labors, and effort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create
				the illusion of gaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been
				splashed on the walls along Court Way.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5848">
				But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish
				heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the
				streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5849">
				In the Baron’s blue-walled keep, there was fearful
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5850"

					title="522"></span
				>perfection, but the Count and his lady saw the price being
				paid&mdash;guards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that
				told a trained eye they were in regular use. There were checkpoints for
				routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The servants
				revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of
				their shoulders…in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5851">
				“The pressure’s on,” the Count hummed to his lady in their secret
				language. “The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid
				to rid himself of the Duke Leto.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5852">
				“Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5853">
				They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family
				games. It was not a large hall&mdash;perhaps forty meters long and half
				that in width&mdash;but false pillars along the sides had been shaped
				with an abrupt taper, and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the
				illusion of much greater space.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5854">
				“Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron,” the Count said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5855">
				The Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar
				waddling-glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung
				weight. His jowls bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted
				beneath his orange robe. Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone
				where they had been woven into the robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5856">
				At the Baron’s elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in
				close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore
				a tight-fitting black
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5857"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="523"></span
				>tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom.
				Soft-soled slippers covered his small feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5858">
				Lady Fenring, noting the young man’s poise and the sure flow of muscles
				beneath the tunic, thought:
				<i class="calibre2">Here’s one who won’t let himself go to fat.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5859">
				The Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd-Rautha’s arm in a
				possessive grip, said, “My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.”
				And, turning his baby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, “The Count
				and Lady Fenring of whom I’ve spoken.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5860">
				Feyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the
				Lady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of
				figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecru&mdash;simple fitness of form
				without ornament. Gray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene
				Gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly
				disturbing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5861">
				“Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m,” said the Count. He studied Feyd-Rautha. “The,
				hm-m-m-m, <i class="calibre2">precise</i> young man, ah,
				my…hm-m-m-m…dear?” The Count glanced at the Baron. “My dear Baron, you
				say you’ve spoken of us to this <i class="calibre2">precise</i> young
				man? What did you say?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5862">
				“I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you, Count
				Fenring,” the Baron said. And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the manners of a rabbit&mdash;this
					is the most dangerous kind.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5863">
				“Of course!” said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5864">
				Feyd-Rautha found the man’s actions and words almost insulting. They
				stopped just short of something
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-5865"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="524"></span
				>overt that would require notice. The young man focused his attention on
				the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish with
				overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his
				movements&mdash;he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he
				spoke another way. It was difficult to follow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5866">
				“Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so
				rarely,” the Count said, addressing the Baron’s shoulder. “I…ah,
				congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the
				light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5867">
				“You are too kind,” the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that
				his uncle’s eyes did not agree with the courtesy.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5868">
				“When you’re mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you’re hm-mm-m thinking
				deep thoughts,” the Count said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5869">
				<i class="calibre2">There he goes again</i>, Feyd-Rautha thought.
				<i class="calibre2"

					out for satisfaction.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5870">
				Listening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being
				pushed through mush…<i class="calibre2">um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m!</i>
				Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back to the Lady Fenring.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5871">
				“We’re ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man’s time,” she said. “I

				<i class="calibre2"

				“Feyd!” the Baron said. And he thought:

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5876">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5877">
				“You really <i class="calibre2">must</i> be getting ready for the arena,
				Feyd,” the Baron said. “You must be rested and not take any foolish
				risks.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5878">
				Feyd-Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment. “I’m sure everything
				will be as you wish, Uncle.” He nodded to Count Fenring. “Sir.” To the
				lady: “My Lady.” And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing
				at the knot of Families Minor near the double doors.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5879">
				“He’s so young,” the Baron sighed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5880">
				“Um-m-m-m-ah indeed hmmm,” the Count said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5881">
				And the Lady Fenring thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother meant? Is</i

				that <i class="calibre2">a bloodline we must preserve?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5882">
				“We’ve more than an hour before going to the arena,” the Baron said.
				“Perhaps we could have our little talk now, Count Fenring.” He tipped
				his gross head to the right. “There’s a considerable amount of progress
				to be discussed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5883">
				And the Baron thought:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5884">
				The Count spoke to his lady: “Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you mm-m will

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5885">
				“Each day, some time each hour, brings change,” she said. “Mmm-mm.” And

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5888">
				“There’s a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our

				sound-deadening field, feeling the noises of the keep become dull and
				distant.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5889">
				The Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5904">“A…smuggler.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5905">
				“Someone has lied to you, Count,” the Baron said. “Smugglers cannot
				navigate the southern reaches any better than can Rabban’s men. Storms,

				faster than they can be installed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5906">
				“We’ll discuss various types of static another time,” the Count said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5907">
				<i class="calibre2">Ah-h-h-h</i>, the Baron thought. “Have you found
				some mistake in my accounting then?” he demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5908">
				“When you imagine mistakes there can be no self-defense,” the Count
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5909">
				<i class="calibre2">He’s deliberately trying to arouse my anger,</i> the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5910">
				“The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5911">
				“Yes, there were so many convenient accidents,” the Count agreed.
			</p>

				do business.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5915">
				“The only recent business I can recall,” the Baron said, “was
				transportation of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5916">
				“You think you could hold that over the Emperor’s head?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5917">“I wouldn’t think of it!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5918">
				The Count smiled. “Sardaukar commanders could be found who’d confess
				they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen
				scum.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5919">
				“Many might doubt such a confession,” the Baron said, but the threat
				staggered him.
				<i class="calibre2">Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined?</i> he
				wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5920">
				“The Emperor does wish to audit your books,” the Count said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5921">“Anytime.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5922">“You…ah…have no objections?”</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5927">
				“You wish the subject to be changed, eh?” The Count shrugged. “It is the
				Sardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor. They needed practice in

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5928">
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5929">
				“A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business,” the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5930">
				The Count emitted a short, barking laugh. “You think you can harness the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5931">
				“There never were enough of them for that,” the Baron said. “But the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5932">“Ah-h-h?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5933">
				“You see, Count, I have the Emperor’s prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5934">
				The Count stared at him with glittering intensity. “What possible

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5935">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5936">“Yet?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5937">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5940">
				“There has been unrest,” the Baron admitted. “I’ve had to squeeze rather

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5941">
				“I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor’s

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5942">
				“Of course not,” the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in
				Fenring’s voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5943">
				“Another matter,” the Count said. “We learn that Duke Leto’s Mentat,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5944">
				“I could not bring myself to waste him,” the Baron said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5948">
				“Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor.” The Baron wiped at

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5949">
				“How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5950">
				“His Duke was dead.” The Baron forced a smile. “There’s nothing to fear

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5958">“You think it whim?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5959">
				“What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. I

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5960">
				“With the help of a few Sardaukar.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5962">
				“He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly
				different emphasis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5963">
				The Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the
				careful control. “Ah-h-h, now,” the Baron said. “I hope the Emperor
				doesn’t believe he can move against <i class="calibre2">me</i> in total
				secrecy.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5964">
				“He hopes it won’t become necessary.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5965">
				“The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!” The Baron permitted anger

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5966">
				The Count’s voice went dry and remote as he said: “The Emperor believes

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5967">
				“Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a

				“It’s the Emperor’s sincere hope he’ll never have to charge you with

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5972">
				The Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit
				only the expression of hurt, but he managed. “I’ve been a most loyal
				subject. These words hurt me beyond my capacity to express.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5973">
				“Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m,” said the Count.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5974">
				The Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, “It’s

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5975">“Indeed,” said the Count.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5976">
				They moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward
				the clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow
				tolling somewhere in the keep&mdash;twenty-minute warning for the arena
				gathering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5977">
				“The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them,” the Count said, nodding
				toward the people they approached.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5978">
				<i class="calibre2">Double meaning…double meaning,</i> the Baron
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5979">
				He looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his
				hall&mdash;the mounted bull’s head and the oil painting of the Old Duke
				Atreides, the late Duke Leto’s father.
				<span

					id="calibre_link-5980"

				>They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5981">
				“Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science,” the Count said as they picked
				up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting
				room&mdash;a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white
				and purple tile.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5982">
				“And what science is that?” the Baron asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5983">
				“It’s the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent,” the Count said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5984">
				The Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with
				just the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of
				discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them
				when pages threw open the outer doors, revealing the line of ground
				cars, their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5985">
				The Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, “I hope
				you’ll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today,
				Count Fenring.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5986">
				“I ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5987">

				<i class="calibre2"
					>Proces verbal! That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5988">

				>All the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored
				cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him,
				wondering why the Emperor’s <i class="calibre2">errand boy</i> had
				thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of
				the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom did anything he
				felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or held
				himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5991">
				They were seated in the golden box above the triangular
				arena&mdash;horns blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a
				hubbub of people and waving pennants&mdash;when the answer came to the
				Baron.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5992">
				“My dear Baron,” the Count said, leaning close to his ear, “you know,
				don’t you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your
				choice of heir?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5993">
				The Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence
				produced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the
				Count’s lady come through the guards beyond to join the party in the
				golden box.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5994">
				“That’s really why I’m here today,” the Count said. “The Emperor wishes
				me to report on whether you’ve chosen a worthy successor. There’s
				nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask,
				eh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5995">
				“The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!” the Baron grated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5996">
				“We shall see,” Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat
				down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor
				beneath them where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and
				tights&mdash;the black glove and the long knife in his right hand, the
				white glove and the short knife in his left hand.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-5999">“Um-m-m-m,” the Count said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6000">
				The greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha
				paused to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces&mdash;seeing his
				cousines and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn
				relations. They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a
				flutter of colorful clothing and banners.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6001">
				It came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look
				just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was
				not a doubt of the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the
				form of danger without its substance&mdash;yet….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6002">
				Feyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of
				the arena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand
				(white, the sign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long
				blade in the black-gloved hand&mdash;the pure blade that now was unpure,
				his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory:
				poison on the black blade.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6003">
				The adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to
				sense the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly
				guarded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6004">
				This moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd-Rautha dragged it out
				with the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and
				distractors, checking their equipment with a measuring stare&mdash;gyves
				in place with their prickles sharp and glistening, the barbs and hooks
				waving with their blue streamers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6005">
				Feyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6006">

				>The slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha
				led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle’s
				box. He caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6008">The music stopped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6009">
				Into the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and
				shouted. “I dedicate this truth to….” And he paused, knowing his uncle
				would think:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The young fool’s going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and
					cause a ruckus!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6010">
				“…to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!” Feyd-Rautha
				shouted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6011">
				And he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6012">
				The music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his men
				scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only
				those wearing the proper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself
				that he never used the pru-door and seldom needed distractors. But it
				was good to know they were available this day&mdash;special plans
				sometimes involved special dangers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6013">
				Again, silence settled over the arena.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6014">
				Feyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which
				the gladiator would emerge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6015">The special gladiator.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6016">
				The plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct,
				Feyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged&mdash;that was the
				danger. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man’s unconscious
				to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the
				vital word in his mind, mouthing
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6017"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="537"></span
				>it without sound: “Scum!” To the audience, it would appear that an
				undrugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron.
				And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6018">
				A low humming arose from the red door’s servo-motors as they were armed
				for opening.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6019">
				Feyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was
				the critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the
				trained eye much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be
				hyped on elacca drug to come out kill-ready in fighting stance&mdash;but
				you had to watch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in
				defense, whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands.
				The way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to
				counter and feint.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6020">The red door slammed open.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6021">
				Out charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted
				eyes. His skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug,
				but Feyd-Rautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards
				and the red belt of a semishield&mdash;the belt’s arrow pointing left to
				indicate the slave’s left side was shielded. He held his knife
				sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained
				fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his shielded side
				toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6022">
				“I like not the look of this one,” said one of Feyd-Rautha’s barbmen.
				“Are you sure he’s drugged, m’Lord?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6023">

				Feyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6027">
				“What has he done to his arm?” asked one of the distractors.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6028">
				Feyd-Rautha’s attention went to a bloody scratch on the man’s left
				forearm, followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design
				drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotards&mdash;a wet shape
				there: the formalized outline of a hawk.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6029">Hawk!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6030">
				Feyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at
				him with uncommon alertness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6031">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>It’s one of Duke Leto’s fighting men we took on Arrakis!</i
				>
				Feyd-Rautha thought. <i class="calibre2">No simple gladiator this!</i> A
				chill ran through him, and he wondered if Hawat had another plan for
				this arena&mdash;a feint within a feint within a feint. And only the
				slavemaster prepared to take the blame!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6032">
				Feyd-Rautha’s chief handler spoke at his ear: “I like not the look on
				that one, m’Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6033">
				“I’ll set my own barbs,” Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long,
				hooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These
				barbs, too, were supposed to be drugged&mdash;but not this time, and the
				chief handler might die because of that. But it was all part of the
				plan.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6034">
				<i class="calibre2">“You’ll come out of this a hero,”</i> Hawat had
				said.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“Killed your gladiator man to man and in spite of treachery.
					<span

					>The slavemaster will be executed and your man will step into his

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6036">
				Feyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the
				moment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands
				above him were aware that something was wrong. The gladiator had the
				correct skin color for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did
				not tremble. The aficionados would be whispering among themselves now:
				“See how he stands. He should be agitated&mdash;attacking or retreating.
				See how he conserves his strength, how he waits. He should not wait.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6037">
				Feyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle.
				<i class="calibre2">Let there be treachery in Hawat’s mind,</i> he
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I can handle this slave. And it’s my long knife that carries the
					poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn’t know that.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6038">
				“Hai, Harkonnen!” the slave called. “Are you prepared to die?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6039">
				Deathly stillness gripped the arena.
				<i class="calibre2">Slaves did not issue the challenge!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6040">
				Now, Feyd-Rautha had a clear view of the gladiator’s eyes, saw the cold
				ferocity of despair in them. He marked the way the man stood, loose and
				ready, muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried
				Hawat’s message to this one:
				<i class="calibre2">“You’ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron.”</i>
				That much of the scheme was as they’d planned it, then.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6041">
				A tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha’s mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing
				success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6042">
				<span

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6044">
				<i class="calibre2">No one in the galleries can mistake it now</i>,
				Feyd-Rautha thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6045">
				This slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror.
				Every movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was
				no hope for him&mdash;he could not win. He should have been filled with
				the stories of the poisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his
				white-gloved hand. The na-Baron never gave quick death; he delighted in
				demonstrating rare poisons, could stand in the arena pointing out
				interesting side effects on a writhing victim. There was fear in the
				slave, yes&mdash;but not terror.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6046">
				Feyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6047">The gladiator pounced.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6048">
				His feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever
				seen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the
				tendons of the na-Baron’s left leg.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6049">
				Feyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave’s right
				forearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not
				withdraw them without ripping tendons.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6050">
				A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6051">
				The sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6052">
				He knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the
				Fenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him. There could
				be no interference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front
				of

					id="calibre_link-6053"

				>witnesses. And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only
				one way&mdash;threat to himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6054">
				The slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to
				his arm with the pennant. “I do not feel your needle!” he shouted. Again
				he crept forward, knife ready, left side presented, his body bent
				backward to give it the greatest surface of protection from the
				half-shield.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6055">
				That action, too, didn’t escape the galleries. Sharp cries came from the
				family boxes. Feyd-Rautha’s handlers were calling out to ask if he
				needed them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6056">
				He waved them back to the pru-door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6057">
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6058">
				Feyd-Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiator’s crablike advance.
				Arena sand grated underfoot. He heard the slave’s panting, smelled his
				own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6059">
				Steadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second
				barb ready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha appeared to stumble,
				heard the scream from the galleries.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6060">Again, the slave pounced.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6061">
				<i class="calibre2">Gods, what a fighting man!</i> Feyd-Rautha thought
				as he leaped aside. Only youth’s quickness saved him, but he left the
				second barb buried in the deltoid muscle of the slave’s right arm.
			</p>

				>Shrill cheers rained from the galleries.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6064">
				<i class="calibre2">They cheer me now</i>, Feyd-Rautha thought. He heard
				the wildness in the voices just as Hawat had said he would. They’d never
				cheered a family fighter that way before. And he thought with an edge of
				grimness on a thing Hawat had told him:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“It’s easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6065">
				Swiftly, Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all
				could see clearly. He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the
				advancing slave.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6066">
				The man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm,
				then sped in pursuit.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6067">
				<i class="calibre2">Let the family see me do this thing,</i> Feyd-Rautha
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I am their enemy: let them think of me as they see me now.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6068">He drew his short blade.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6069">
				“I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine,” the gladiator said. “Your tortures
				cannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade before a handler
				lays finger to my flesh. And I’ll have you dead beside me!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6070">
				Feyd-Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the
				poison. “Try this on,” he said, and feinted with the short blade in his
				other hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6071">
				The slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to
				grapple the na-Baron’s short blade&mdash;the one in the white-gloved
				hand that tradition said should carry the poison.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6072">
				“You will die, Harkonnen,” the gladiator gasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6073">
				They struggled sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha’s shield met
				the slave’s halfshield, a blue
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6074"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="543"></span
				>glow marked the contact. The air around them filled with ozone from the
				field.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6075">
				“Die on your own poison!” the slave grated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6076">
				He began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he
				thought carried the poison.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6077">
				<i class="calibre2">Let them see this!</i> Feyd-Rautha thought. He
				brought down the long blade, felt it clang uselessly against the barbed
				shaft lashed to the slave’s arm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6078">
				Feyd-Rautha felt a moment of desperation. He had not thought the barbed
				shafts would be an advantage for the slave. But they gave the man
				another shield. And the strength of this gladiator! The short blade was
				being forced inward inexorably, and Feyd-Rautha focused on the fact that
				a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6079">“Scum!” Feyd-Rautha gasped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6080">
				At the key word, the gladiator’s muscles obeyed with a momentary
				slackness. It was enough for Feyd-Rautha. He opened a space between them
				sufficient for the long blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red
				line down the slave’s chest. There was instant agony in the poison. The
				man disengaged himself, staggered backward.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6081">
				<i class="calibre2">Now, let my dear family watch,</i> Feyd-Rautha
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Let them think on this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought

					poison.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6082">
				Feyd-Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave.
				The man moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthographic
				thing on his
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6083"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="544"></span
				>face now for every watcher to recognize. The death was written there.
				The slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done.
				The wrong blade had carried the poison.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6084">“You!” the man moaned.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6085">
				Feyd-Rautha drew back to give death its space. The paralyzing drug in
				the poison had yet to take full effect, but the man’s slowness told of
				its advance.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6086">
				The slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string&mdash;one
				dragging step at a time. Each step was the only step in his universe. He
				still clutched his knife, but its point wavered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6087">
				“One day…one…of us…will…get…you,” he gasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6088">
				A sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened
				and rolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6089">
				Feyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator
				and rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the
				face when the poison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles.
				But the gladiator came over with his own knife, protruding from his
				breast.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6090">
				In spite of frustration, there was for Feyd-Rautha a measure of
				admiration for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the
				paralysis to do this thing to himself. With the admiration came the
				realization that here was <i class="calibre2">truly</i> a thing to fear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6091">
				<i class="calibre2">That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6092">
				As he focused on this thought, Feyd-Rautha became
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6093"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="545"></span
				>conscious of the eruption of noise from the stands and galleries around
				him. They were cheering with utter abandon.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6094">
				Feyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6095">
				All were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep
				contemplation&mdash;and the Count and his lady, both of whom were
				staring down at him, their faces masked by smiles.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6096">
				Count Fenring turned to his lady, said: “Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful
				um-m-m-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6097">
				“His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6098">
				The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the
				arena, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2">If someone could get that close to one of mine!</i>
				Rage began to replace his fear.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I’ll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night…and if
					this Count and his lady had a hand in it….</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6099">
				The conversation in the Baron’s box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha,
				the voices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all
				around:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6100">“Head! Head! Head! Head!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6101">
				The Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly,
				controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward
				the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the
				slave.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6102">
				Feyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>They think they honor me. Let them see what I think!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6103">
				He saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6104"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="546"></span
				>do the honors, waved them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated.
				<i class="calibre2">They think they honor me with just a head!</i> he
				thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator’s hands around the protruding
				knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6105">
				It was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers.
				“Bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands,” he said. “The man
				earned it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6106">
				In the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: “A
				grand gesture, that&mdash;true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as
				courage.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6107">
				“He insults the crowd by refusing the head,” the Baron muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6108">
				“Not at all,” Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers
				around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6109">
				And the Baron noted the line of her neck&mdash;a truly lovely flowing of
				muscles&mdash;like a young boy’s.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6110">
				“They like what your nephew did,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6111">
				As the import of Feyd-Rautha’s gesture penetrated to the most distant
				seats, as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator
				intact, the Baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the
				reaction correctly. The people were going wild, beating on each other,
				screaming and stamping.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6112">
				The Baron spoke wearily. “I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send
				people home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I
				share their elation.” He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant
				above them dipped the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box&mdash;once,
				twice, three times&mdash;signal for a fete.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6113">
				Feyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the
				<span

					id="calibre_link-6114"

					title="547"></span
				>golden box, his weapons sheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the
				undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: “A fete, Uncle?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6115">
				The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6116">
				“In your honor, Feyd!” the Baron called down. And again, he caused the
				pennant to be dipped in signal.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6117">
				Across the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were
				leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6118">
				“You ordered the pru-shields dropped, Baron?” the Count asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6119">
				“No one will harm the lad,” the Baron said. “He’s a hero.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6120">
				The first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their
				shoulders, began parading around the arena.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6121">
				“He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of
				Harko tonight,” the Baron said. “They’d give him the last of their food
				and drink just for his company.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6122">
				The Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his
				suspensors. “You will forgive me, please. There are matters that require
				my immediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6123">
				The Count arose, bowed. “Certainly, Baron. We’re looking forward to the
				fete. I’ve ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6124">
				“Yes,” the Baron said. “The fete.” He turned, was enveloped by guards as

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6172">
				Wind-raked dead leaves strewed the cliffbase where the sietch children

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6177">
				The troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6178">
				There came a faint thumping from the rocks, a sound no louder than mice

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6179">Again, the bird chirruped.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6180">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6181">
				Once more, the bird chirruped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6182">
				The troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks, but there was
				a stillness of breath about the Fremen now that filled Paul with
				caution, and he noted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to
				withdraw, pulling in upon herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6183">
				There was rock underfoot now, a faint gray swishing of robes around
				them, and Paul sensed a relaxing of discipline, but still that
				quiet-of-the-person about Chani and the others. He followed a shadow
				shape&mdash;up steps, a turn, more steps, into a tunnel, past two
				moisture-sealed doors and into a globelighted narrow passage with yellow
				rock walls and ceiling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6184">
				All around him, Paul saw the Fremen throwing back their hoods, removing
				nose plugs, breathing deeply. Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani,
				found that she had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed
				bodies. Someone jostled him, said, “Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It’s
				always this way.”

				>On his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned
				toward Paul. The stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even
				darker under the yellow globes. “Throw off your hood, Usul,” Farok said.
				“You’re home.” And he helped Paul, releasing the hood catch, elbowing a
				space around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6187">
				Paul slipped out his nose plugs, swung the mouth baffle aside. The odor
				of the place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esthers of
				reclaimed wastes, everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it
				all, a turbulence of spice and spicelike harmonics.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6188">
				“Why are we waiting, Farok?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6189">
				“For the Reverend Mother, I think. You heard the message&mdash;poor

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6190">
				<i class="calibre2">Poor Chani?</i> Paul asked himself. He looked

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6191">
				Farok took a deep breath. “The smells of home,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6192">
				Paul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air, that there was
				no irony in his tone. He heard his mother cough then, and her voice came
				back to him through the press of the troop: “How rich the odors of your
				sietch, Stilgar. I see you do much working with the spice…you make
				paper…plastics…and isn’t that chemical explosives?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6193">
				“You know this from what you smell?” It was another man’s voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6194">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6197">
				<i class="calibre2">Liet</i>, Paul thought. Then:
				<i class="calibre2">Chani, daughter of Liet.</i> The pieces fell
				together in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6198">
				Paul looked at Farok, asked: “Is it the Liet known as Kynes?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6199">
				“There is only one Liet,” Farok said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6200">

				<i class="calibre2">Then Liet-Kynes is dead,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6201">
				“It was Harkonnen treachery,” someone hissed. “They made it seem an
				accident…lost in the desert…a ’thopter crash….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6202">
				Paul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save
				them from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts
				searching for two strays in the desert…another victim of the Harkonnens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6203">
				“Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?” Farok asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6204">
				Before Paul could answer, there came a low call and the troop swept
				forward into a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself
				in an open space confronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a
				flowing wraparound garment of brilliant orange and green. Her arms were
				bare to the shoulders, and he could see she wore no stillsuit. Her skin
				was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from her high forehead, throwing
				emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose between the dense
				darkness of her eyes.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6207">
				“<i class="calibre2">This</i> bested my Jamis?” she demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6208">
				“Be silent, Harah,” Stilgar said. “It was Jamis’ doing&mdash;<i

				invoked the tahaddi al-burhan.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6209">
				“He’s not but a boy!” she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from
				side to side, setting the water tallies to jingling. “My children made
				fatherless by another child? Surely, ’twas an accident!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6210">
				“Usul, how many years have you?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6211">
				“Fifteen Standard,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6212">
				Stilgar swept his eyes over the troop. “Is there one among you cares to
				challenge me?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6213">Silence.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6214">
				Stilgar looked at the woman. “Until I’ve learned his weirding ways, I’d
				not challenge him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6215">
				She returned his stare. “But&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6216">
				“You saw the stranger woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?”
				Stilgar asked. “She’s an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The
				mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6217">
				“Lisan al-Gaib,” the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned
				them back toward Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6218">
				<i class="calibre2">The legend again</i>, Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6219">
				“Perhaps,” Stilgar said. “It hasn’t been tested, though.” He returned
				his attention to Paul. “Usul, it’s our way that you’ve now the
				responsibility for Jamis’ woman here and for his two sons. His yali…his
				quarters, are yours. His coffee service is yours…and this, his woman.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6220">
				Paul studied the woman, wondering:

				Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him, waiting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6222">
				Someone whispered: “There’s work to do. Say how you accept her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6223">
				Stilgar said: “Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6224">
				Harah lifted her arms, turning slowly on one heel. “I am still young,
				Usul. It’s said I still look as young as when I was with Geoff…before
				Jamis bested him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6225">
				<i class="calibre2">Jamis killed another to win her</i>, Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6226">
				Paul said: “If I accept her as servant, may I yet change my mind at a
				later time?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6227">
				“You’d have a year to change your decision,” Stilgar said. “After that,
				she’s a free woman to choose as she wishes…or you could free her to
				choose for herself at any time. But she’s your responsibility, no matter
				what, for one year…and you’ll always share some responsibility for the
				sons of Jamis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6228">
				“I accept her as servant,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6229">
				Harah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. “But I’m young!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6230">
				Stilgar looked at Paul, said: “Caution’s a worthy trait in a man who’d
				lead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6231">
				“But I’m young!” Harah repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6232">
				“Be silent,” Stilgar commanded. “If a thing has merit, it’ll be. Show
				Usul to his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6233">“Oh-h-h-h!” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6234">
				Paul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation. He felt

				that it would be a mistake.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6236">
				He faced Harah, pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her
				fear and awe, said: “Show me my quarters, Harah! We will discuss your
				youth another time.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6237">
				She backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. “He has
				the weirding voice,” she husked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6238">
				“Stilgar,” Paul said. “Chani’s father put heavy obligation on me. If
				there’s anything….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6239">
				“It’ll be decided in council,” Stilgar said. “You can speak then.” He
				nodded in dismissal, turned away with the rest of the troop following
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6240">
				Paul took Harah’s arm, noting how cool her flesh seemed, feeling her
				tremble. “I’ll not harm you, Harah,” he said. “Show me our quarters.”
				And he smoothed his voice with relaxants.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6241">
				“You’ll not cast me out when the year’s gone?” she said. “I know for
				true I’m not as young as once I was.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6242">
				“As long as I live you’ll have a place with me,” he said. He released
				her arm. “Come now, where are our quarters?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6243">
				She turned, led the way down the passage, turning right into a wide
				cross tunnel lighted by evenly spaced yellow overhead globes. The stone
				floor was smooth, swept clean of sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6244">
				Paul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked.
				“You do not hate me, Harah?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6245">“Why should I hate you?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6246">
				She nodded to a cluster of children who stared at
				<span

					id="calibre_link-6247"

				>them from the raised ledge of a side passage. Paul glimpsed adult

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6248">“I…bested Jamis.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6249">
				“Stilgar said the ceremony was held and you’re a friend of Jamis.” She

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6251">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6252">“Don’t you mourn him?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6253">
				“In the time of mourning, I’ll mourn him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6254">
				They passed an arched opening. Paul looked through it at men and women
				working with stand-mounted machinery in a large, bright chamber. There
				seemed an extra tempo of urgency to them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6255">
				“What’re they doing in there?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6256">
				She glanced back as they passed beyond the arch, said: “They hurry to

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6258">
				“Until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6259">
				Paul caught himself in a stumble, sensing an arrested instant of time,
				remembering a fragment, a visual projection of prescience&mdash;but it

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6260">
				“The Sardaukar hunt us,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6261">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6266">“The planting goes on.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6267">
				“What’re dew collectors?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6268">
				The glance she turned on him was full of surprise. “Don’t they teach you

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6269">“Not about dew collectors.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6270">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6271">“Well, what are they?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6272">
				“Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg,” she said, “how do
				you suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in
				its own little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of
				chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can see them glistening in
				the dawn if you look down from a high place. White reflects. But when
				Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the
				dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface condenses moisture out
				of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6273">
				“Dew collectors,” he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a

				“I’ll mourn Jamis in the proper time for it,” she said, as though her

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6276">“We don’t have that problem.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6277">“But if&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6278">“Harah!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6279">
				She recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6280">
				They passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on
				their left. “What’s made there?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6281">
				“They repair the weaving machinery,” she said. “But it must be
				dismantled by tonight.” She gestured at a tunnel branching to their
				left. “Through there and beyond, that’s food processing and stillsuit
				maintenance.” She looked at Paul. “Your suit looks new. But if it needs
				work, I’m good with suits. I work in the factory in season.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6282">
				They began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of
				openings in the tunnel’s sides. A file of men and women passed them
				carrying packs that gurgled heavily, the smell of spice strong about
				them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6283">
				“They’ll not get our water,” Harah said. “Or our spice. You can be sure
				of that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6284">
				Paul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy
				carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on
				the walls, piled cushions. People in the openings fell silent at their
				approach, followed Paul with untamed stares.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6285">
				“The people find it strange you bested Jamis,” Harah said. “Likely
				you’ll have some proving to do when we’re settled in a new sietch.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6286">
				“I don’t like killing,” he said.

				>“Thus Stilgar tells it,” she said, but her voice betrayed her
				disbelief.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6289">
				A shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them. They came to another side
				opening wider than any of the others Paul had seen. He slowed his pace,
				staring in at a room crowded with children sitting cross-legged on a
				maroon-carpeted floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6290">
				At a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow
				wraparound, a projecto-stylus in one hand. The board was filled with
				designs&mdash;circles, wedges and curves, snake tracks and squares,
				flowing arcs split by parallel lines. The woman pointed to the designs
				one after the other as fast as she could move the stylus, and the
				children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6291">
				Paul listened, hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper
				into the sietch with Harah.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6292">
				“Tree,” the children chanted. “Tree, grass, dune, wind, mountain, hill,
				fire, lightning, rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, full, winter,
				cold, empty, erosion, summer, cavern, day, tension, moon, night,
				caprock, sandtide, slope, planting, binder….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6293">
				“You conduct classes at a time like this?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6294">
				Her face went somber and grief edged her voice: “What Liet taught us, we
				cannot pause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be forgotten.
				It’s the Chakobsa way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6295">
				She crossed the tunnel to the left, stepped up onto a ledge, parted
				gauzy orange hangings and stood aside: “Your yali is ready for you,
				Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6296">
				Paul hesitated before joining her on the ledge. He felt a sudden
				reluctance to be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was
				surrounded by a way of life that
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6297"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="562"></span
				>could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and values.
				He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him
				in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare&mdash;the wild jihad,
				the religious war he felt he should avoid at any cost.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6298">
				“This is your yali,” Harah said. “Why do you hesitate?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6299">
				Paul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from
				her, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short
				entrance way and then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a
				side&mdash;thick blue carpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics
				hiding the rock walls, glowglobes tuned to yellow overhead bobbing
				against draped yellow ceiling fabrics.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6300">
				The effect was that of an ancient tent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6301">
				Harah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his
				face. “The children are with a friend,” she said. “They will present
				themselves later.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6302">
				Paul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin
				hangings to the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with
				cushions piled around the walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct,
				saw the outlet cunningly hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead
				of him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6303">
				“Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit?” Harah asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6304">“No…thank you.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6305">“Shall I bring food?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6306">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6307">
				“There is a reclamation chamber off the other room.” She gestured. “For
				your comfort and convenience when you’re out of your stillsuit.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6308">
				<span

				>“You said we have to leave this sietch,” Paul said. “Shouldn’t we be
				packing or something?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6310">
				“It will be done in its time,” she said. “The butchers have yet to
				penetrate to our region.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6311">
				Still she hesitated, staring at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6312">“What is it?” he demanded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6313">
				“You’ve not the eyes of the Ibad,” she said. “It’s strange but not
				entirely unattractive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6314">
				“Get the food,” he said. “I’m hungry.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6315">
				She smiled at him&mdash;a knowing, woman’s smile that he found
				disquieting. “I am your servant,” she said, and whirled away in one
				lithe motion, ducking behind a heavy wall hanging that revealed another
				passage before falling back into place.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6316">
				Feeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the
				right and into the larger room. He stood there a moment caught by
				uncertainty. And he wondered where Chani was…Chani who had just lost her
				father.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6317">
				<i class="calibre2">We’re alike in that,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6318">
				A wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by
				the intervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And
				again. Paul realized someone was calling the time. He focused on the
				fact that he had seen no clocks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6319">
				The faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on
				the omnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already
				suppressed the odorous assault on his senses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6320">
				And he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the
				future would incorporate her…and
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6321"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="564"></span
				>the daughter she bore. Mutable time-awareness danced around him. He
				shook his head sharply, focusing his attention on the evidences that
				spoke of profound depth and breadth in this Fremen culture that had
				swallowed them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6322">With its subtle oddities.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6323">
				He had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that
				suggested far greater differences than anything he had yet encountered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6324">
				There was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use
				anywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch
				stench&mdash;strong ones, common ones.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6325">
				He heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food,
				and turned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of
				hangings, he saw two young boys&mdash;perhaps aged nine and
				ten&mdash;staring out at him with greedy eyes. Each wore a small
				kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a hand on the hilt.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6326">
				And Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen&mdash;that their children
				fought as ferociously as the adults.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6335">And more were coming.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6343">
				Men came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them,
				stirring up dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6344">
				Stilgar took her arm, led her back into the acoustical horn that formed
				the rear limits of the ledge. He indicated a rock bench within the horn.
				“The Reverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she
				comes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6345">
				“I prefer to stand,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6346">
				She watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out
				at the crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor
				now.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6347">And still they came.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6348">
				Out on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in

				people come to see her risk her life.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6349">
				A way was opened through the crowd to her right, and she saw Paul
				approaching flanked by two small boys. There was a swaggering air of
				self-importance about the children. They kept hands on knives, scowled
				at the wall of people on either side.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6350">
				“The sons of Jamis who are now the sons of Usul,” Stilgar said. “They

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6351">

				Paul climbed to the ledge, leaving the children below. He stopped in

				happening? I thought I was being summoned to council.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6355">
				Stilgar raised a hand for silence, gestured to his left where another
				way had been opened in the throng. Chani came down the lane opened
				there, her elfin face set in lines of grief. She had removed her
				stillsuit and wore a graceful blue wraparound that exposed her thin
				arms. Near the shoulder on her left arm, a green kerchief had been tied.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6356">
				<i class="calibre2">Green for mourning,</i> Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6357">
				It was one of the customs the two sons of Jamis had explained to him by

				guardian-father.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6358">
				“Are you the Lisan al-Gaib?” they had asked. And Paul had sensed the
				jihad in their words, shrugged off the question with one of his
				own&mdash;learning then that Kaleff, the elder of the two, was ten, and
				the natural son of Geoff. Orlop, the younger, was eight, the natural son
				of Jamis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6359">
				It had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because
				he asked it, keeping away the curious, allowing him the time to nurse
				his thoughts and prescient memories, to plan a way to prevent the jihad.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6360">
				Now, standing beside his mother on the cavern ledge and looking out at

				Jessica ignored Chani’s approach, focusing all her attention on the
				woman in the litter&mdash;a crone, a wrinkled and shriveled ancient
				thing in a black gown with hood thrown back to reveal the tight knot of
				gray hair and the stringy neck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6364">
				The litter-carriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6365">
				<i class="calibre2">So this is their Reverend Mother,</i> Jessica
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6366">
				The old woman leaned heavily on Chani as she hobbled toward Jessica,
				looking like a collection of sticks draped in the black robe. She
				stopped in front of Jessica, peered upward for a long moment before
				speaking in a husky whisper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6367">
				“So you’re the one.” The old head nodded once precariously on the thin
				neck. “The Shadout Mapes was right to pity you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6368">
				Jessica spoke quickly, scornfully: “I need no one’s pity.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6369">
				“That remains to be seen,” husked the old woman. She turned with
				surprising quickness and faced the throng. “Tell them, Stilgar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6370">“Must I?” he asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6371">
				“We are the people of Misr,” the old woman rasped. “Since our Sunni
				ancestors fled from Nilotic al-Ourouba, we have known flight and death.
				The young go on that our people shall not die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6372">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6375">
				“Tonight we must leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long and

				horn behind the ledge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6376">
				Still the throng remained silent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6377">
				“The Reverend Mother tells me she cannot survive another hajra,” Stilgar
				said. “We have lived before without a Reverend Mother, but it is not

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6378">
				Now, the throng stirred, rippling with whispers and currents of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6379">
				“That this may not come to pass,” Stilgar said, “our new Sayyadina

				Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6383">
				“That we may not lose all if Jessica of the Weirding should fail,”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6386">
				A susurrant response arose from the crowd: “She has seen the waters.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6387">
				“I consecrate the daughter of Liet in the Sayyadina,” husked the old

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6388">
				“She is accepted,” the crowd responded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6389">

				He turned and looked back at the one they called Reverend Mother,
				studying the dried crone features, the fathomless blue fixation of her
				eyes. She looked as though a breeze would blow her away, yet there was
				that about her which suggested she might stand untouched in the path of
				a coriolis storm. She carried the same aura of power that he remembered
				from the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam who had tested him with

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6392">
				“I, the Reverend Mother Ramallo, whose voice speaks as a multitude, say

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6393">
				“It is fitting,” the crowd responded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6394">

				Now, Jessica felt herself at the focus of danger, knowing its presence

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6399">
				A band of men made its way through a serpentine path opened in the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6400">

				black pits of their eyes stared back at her without wavering.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6402">
				A furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack, wafted across
				Jessica. <i class="calibre2">The spice?</i> she wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6403">
				“Is there water?” Chani asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6404">
				The watermaster on the left, a man with a purple scar line across the
				bridge of his nose, nodded once. “There is water, Sayyadina,” he said,
				“but we cannot drink of it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6405">“Is there seed?” Chani asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6406">
				“There is seed,” the man said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6407">
				Chani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack. “Blessed is the
				water and its seed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6408">
				There was familiarity to the rite, and Jessica looked
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6409"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="572"></span
				>back at the Reverend Mother Ramallo. The old woman’s eyes were closed
				and she sat hunched over as though asleep.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6410">
				“Sayyadina Jessica,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6411">
				Jessica turned to see the girl staring up at her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6412">
				“Have you tasted the blessed water?” Chani asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6413">
				Before Jessica could answer, Chani said: “It is not possible that you
				have tasted the blessed water. You are outworlder and unprivileged.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6414">
				A sigh passed through the crowd, a susurration of robes that made the
				nape hairs creep on Jessica’s neck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6415">
				“The crop was large and the maker has been destroyed,” Chani said. She
				began unfastening a coiled spout fixed to the top of the sloshing sack.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6416">
				Now, Jessica felt the sense of danger boiling around her. She glanced at
				Paul, saw that he was caught up in the mystery of the ritual and had
				eyes only for Chani.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6417">
				<i class="calibre2">Has he seen this moment in time?</i> Jessica
				wondered. She rested a hand on her abdomen, thinking of the unborn
				daughter there, asking herself:
				<i class="calibre2">Do I have the right to risk us both?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6418">
				Chani lifted the spout toward Jessica, said: “Here is the Water of Life,
				the water that is greater than water&mdash;Kan, the water that frees the
				soul. If you be a Reverend Mother, it opens the universe to you. Let
				Shai-hulud judge now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6419">
				Jessica felt herself torn between duty to her unborn child and duty to
				Paul. For Paul, she knew, she should take that spout and drink of the
				sack’s contents, but as she bent to the proffered spout, her senses told
				her its peril.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6420">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-6421"

				>The stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons
				that she knew, but unlike them, too.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6422">
				“You must drink it now,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6423">
				<i class="calibre2">There’s no turning back,</i> Jessica reminded
				herself. But nothing in all her Bene Gesserit training came into her
				mind to help her through this instant.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6424">
				<i class="calibre2">What is it?</i> Jessica asked herself.
				<i class="calibre2">Liquor? A drug?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6425">
				She bent over the spout, smelled the esthers of cinnamon, remembering
				then the drunkenness of Duncan Idaho.
				<i class="calibre2">Spice liquor?</i> she asked herself. She took the
				siphon tube in her mouth, pulled up only the most minuscule sip. It
				tasted of the spice, a faint bite acrid on the tongue.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6426">
				Chani pressed down on the skin bag. A great gulp of the stuff surged
				into Jessica’s mouth and before she could help herself, she swallowed
				it, fighting to retain her calmness and dignity.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6427">
				“To accept a little-death is worse than death itself,” Chani said. She
				stared at Jessica, waiting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6428">
				And Jessica stared back, still holding the spout in her mouth. She
				tasted the sack’s contents in her nostrils, in the roof of her mouth, in
				her cheeks, in her eyes&mdash;a biting sweetness, now.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6429"><i class="calibre2">Cool.</i></p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6430">
				Again, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica’s mouth.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6431">
				<i class="calibre2">Delicate.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6432">
				Jessica studied Chani’s face&mdash;elfin features&mdash;seeing the
				traces of Liet-Kynes there as yet unfixed by time.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6433">
				<i class="calibre2">This is a drug they feed me,</i> Jessica told
				herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6434">
				But it was unlike any other drug of her experience,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6435"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="574"></span
				>and Bene Gesserit training included the taste of many drugs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6436">
				Chani’s features were so clear, as though outlined in light.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6437">
				<i class="calibre2">A drug.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6438">
				Whirling silence settled around Jessica. Every fiber of her body
				accepted the fact that something profound had happened to it. She felt
				that she was a conscious mote, smaller than any subatomic particle, yet
				capable of motion and of sensing her surroundings. Like an abrupt
				revelation&mdash;the curtains whipped away&mdash;she realized she had
				become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-6439"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="575"></span
				>herself. She was the mote, yet not the mote.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6440">
				The cavern remained around her&mdash;the people. She sensed them: Paul,
				Chani, Stilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6441">
				<i class="calibre2">Reverend Mother!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6442">
				At the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the
				Reverend Mother ordeal, that the drug took them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6443">
				Jessica focused her attention on the Reverend Mother Ramallo, aware now
				that all this was happening in a frozen instant of time&mdash;suspended
				time for her alone.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6444">
				<i class="calibre2">Why is time suspended?</i> she asked herself. She
				stared at the frozen expressions around her, seeing a dust mote above
				Chani’s head, stopped there.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6445">Waiting.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6446">
				The answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness:
				her personal time was suspended to save her life.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6447">
				She focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking
				within, and was confronted immediately with a cellular core, a pit of
				blackness from which she recoiled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6448">
				<i class="calibre2">That is the place where we cannot look,</i> she
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>There is the place the Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to
					mention&mdash;the place where only a Kwisatz Haderach may look.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6449">
				This realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she
				ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a
				mote-self that searched within her for danger.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6450">
				She found it within the drug she had swallowed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6451">
				The stuff was dancing particles within her, its motions so rapid that
				even frozen time could not stop them. Dancing particles. She began
				recognizing familiar structures, atomic linkages: a carbon atom here,
				helical wavering…a glucose molecule. An entire chain of molecules
				confronted her, and she recognized a protein…a methyl-protein
				configuration.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6452">
				<i class="calibre2">Ah-h-h!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6453">
				It was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the
				poison.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6454">
				With her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen
				mote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of
				oxygen…hydrogen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6455">
				The change spread…faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened its
				surface of contact.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6456">
				The suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her, and she sensed motion.
				The tube spout from the sack was touched to her mouth&mdash;gently,
				collecting a drop of moisture.
			</p>

				Jessica thought. <i class="calibre2">Why?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6459">
				Someone eased her to a sitting position. She saw the old Reverend Mother
				Ramallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge. A dry
				hand touched her neck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6460">
				And there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness!
				Jessica tried to reject it, but the mote swept closer…closer.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6461">They touched!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6462">
				It was like an ultimate <i class="calibre2">simpatico,</i> being two

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6463">
				<i class="calibre2">With the old Reverend Mother!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6464">
				But Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn’t think of herself as old.
				An image unfolded before the mutual mind’s eye: a young girl with a
				dancing spirit and tender humor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6465">
				Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, “Yes, that is how I
				am.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6466">
				Jessica could only accept the words, not respond to them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6467">
				“You’ll have it all soon, Jessica,” the inward image said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6468">
				<i class="calibre2">This is hallucination,</i> Jessica told herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6469">
				“You know better than that,” the inward image said. “Swiftly now, do not
				fight me. There isn’t much time. We….” There came a long pause, then:
				“You should’ve told us you were pregnant!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6470">
				Jessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. “Why?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6471">
				“This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?”
			</p>

				<span

				>Jessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another

				there, circling. It radiated pure terror.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6474">
				“You’ll have to be strong,” the old Reverend Mother’s image-presence
				said. “Be thankful it’s a daughter you carry. This would’ve killed a

				daughter-presence. Absorb the fear…soothe…use your courage and your
				strength…gently now…gently….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6475">
				The other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to
				touch it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6476">
				Terror threatened to overwhelm her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6477">
				She fought it the only way she knew:
				<i class="calibre2">“I shall not fear. Fear is the mind-killer….”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6478">
				The litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent
				against her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6479">
				<i class="calibre2">Words won’t work,</i> Jessica told herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6480">
				She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love,
				comfort, a warm snuggling of protection.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6481">The terror receded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6482">
				Again, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6483">
				“Time compels me,” the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. “I

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6489">
				She knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover&mdash;virile,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6490">
				There was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the

				Too late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and,
				in dying, pouring her experiences into Jessica’s awareness as water is
				poured into a cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as

				left her life in Jessica’s memory with one last sighing blur of words.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6493">
				“I’ve been a long time waiting for you,” she said. “Here is my life.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6501">
				Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6502">
				A terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization

				became clearer.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6503">
				The sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as

				Before Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6517">

				>to Jessica that the Fremen culture was far older than she had

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6522">
				There had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6525">
				Jessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse down that inner corridor,
				saw the weeding out and the selecting that spread men to Rossak and
				Harmonthep. Scenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a
				terrible flower. And she saw the thread of the past carried by Sayyadina
				after Sayyadina&mdash;first by word of mouth, hidden in the sand
				chanteys, then refined through their own Reverend Mothers with the
				discovery of the poison drug on Rossak…and now developed to subtle
				strength on Arrakis in the discovery of the Water of Life.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6526">
				Far down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: “Never to forgive!

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6527">
				But Jessica’s attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of
				Life, seeing its source: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a

				suppressed a gasp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6528">The creature was drowned!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6529">“Mother, are you all right?”</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6536">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6537">
				“Is this all right for me to drink?” He gestured to the sack in Chani’s

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6538">
				She heard the hidden meaning in his words, realized he had detected the
				poison in the original, unchanged substance, that he was concerned for
				her. It occurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits of Paul’s
				prescience. His question revealed much to her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6539">
				“You may drink it,” she said. “It has been changed.” And she looked
				beyond him to see Stilgar staring down at her, the dark-dark eyes

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6540">
				“Now, we know you cannot be false,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6541">
				She sensed hidden meaning here, too, but the muzziness of the drug was
				overpowering her senses. How warm it was and soothing. How beneficent
				these Fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6542">
				Paul saw the drug take hold of his mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6543">
				He searched his memory&mdash;the fixed past, the flux-lines of the
				possible futures. It was like scanning through arrested instants of
				time, disconcerting to the lens of the inner eye. The fragments were
				difficult to understand when snatched out of the flux.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6544">
				This drug&mdash;he could assemble knowledge about it, understand what it

				>knowledge lacked a natural rhythm, lacked a system of mutual

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6546">
				He realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the
				present, but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the
				future.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6547">
				Things persisted in not being what they seemed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6548">
				“Drink it,” Chani said. She waved the hornspout of a watersack under his
				nose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6549">
				Paul straightened, staring at Chani. He felt carnival excitement in the
				air. He knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its
				quintessence of the substance that brought the change onto him. He would
				return to the vision of pure time, of time-become-space. It would perch
				him on the dizzying summit and defy him to understand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6550">
				From behind Chani, Stilgar said: “Drink it, lad. You delay the rite.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6551">
				Paul listened to the crowd then, hearing the wildness in their
				voices&mdash;“Lisan al-Gaib,” they said. “Muad’Dib!” He looked down at
				his mother. She appeared peacefully asleep in a sitting
				position&mdash;her breathing even and deep. A phrase out of the future
				that was his lonely past came into his mind:
				<i class="calibre2">“She sleeps in the Waters of Life.”</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6552">Chani tugged at his sleeve.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6553">
				Paul took the hornspout into his mouth, hearing the people shout. He
				felt the liquid gush into his throat as Chani pressed the sack, sensed
				giddiness in the fumes. Chani removed the spout, handed the sack into
				hands that reached for it from the floor of the cavern. His eyes focused
				on her arm, the green band of mourning there.

				>As she straightened, Chani saw the direction of his gaze, said: “I can
				mourn him even in the happiness of the waters. This was something he
				gave us.” She put her hand into his, pulling him along the ledge. “We
				are alike in a thing, Usul: We have each lost a father to the
				Harkonnens.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6556">
				Paul followed her. He felt that his head had been separated from his
				body and restored with odd connections. His legs were remote and
				rubbery.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6557">
				They entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by
				spaced-out glowglobes. Paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique
				effect on him, opening time like a flower. He found need to steady
				himself against Chani as they turned through another shadowed tunnel.
				The mixture of whipcord and softness he felt beneath her robe stirred
				his blood. The sensation mingled with the work of the drug, folding
				future and past into the present, leaving him the thinnest margin of
				trinocular focus.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6558">
				“I know you, Chani,” he whispered. “We’ve sat upon a ledge above the
				sand while I soothed your fears. We’ve caressed in the dark of the
				sietch. We’ve….” He found himself losing focus, tried to shake his head,
				stumbled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6559">
				Chani steadied him, led him through thick hangings into the yellow
				warmth of a private apartment&mdash;low tables, cushions, a sleeping pad
				beneath an orange spread.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6560">
				Paul grew aware that they had stopped, that Chani stood facing him, and
				that her eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6561">
				“You must tell me,” she whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6562">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6565">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6566">
				He tried to focus on her, but past and future were merging into the
				present, blurring her image. He saw her in countless ways and positions
				and settings.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6567">
				“There’s something frightening in you,” she said. “When I took you away

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6568">
				He forced himself to speak distinctly: “What do you see?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6569">
				She looked down at her hands. “I see a child…in my arms. It’s our child,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6571">
				In a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6572">
				“What is it you want to say?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6573">
				“Usul,” she whispered, and still she trembled.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6574">
				“You cannot back into the future,” he said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6575">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6576">“Usul, help me,” she cried.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6577">
				As she spoke, he felt the drug complete its work within him, ripping
				away the curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6578">
				“You’re so quiet,” Chani said.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6581">
				On one side he could see the Imperium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha
				who flashed toward him like a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raging off

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6582">
				Paul felt himself at the center, at the pivot where the whole structure
				turned, walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness, Chani
				at his side. He could see it stretching ahead of him, a time of relative

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6583">
				“There’s no other place for peace,” he said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6584">

					>No woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father.
					The closest anyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the Padishah
					Emperor was the relationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring, a
					companion from childhood. The measure of Count Fenring’s friendship
					may be seen first in a positive thing: he allayed the Landsraad’s
					suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a billion
					solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts
					as well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second
					major evidence of the Count’s friendship was negative. He refused to
					kill a man even though it was within his capabilities and my father
					commanded it. I will relate this presently.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6608">“Nefud!” the Baron roared.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6609">Men scrambled.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6610">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6611">
				“My Lord Baron,” Nefud said. Only the drug kept the trembling out of his

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6612">
				The Baron scanned the faces around him, seeing the looks of frantic

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6613">
				“How long have you been my guard captain, Nefud?”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6616">

				“Did I not command you to know precisely where the na-Baron was at all

				“After you,” the Baron said, and he gestured to the door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6662">
				Feyd-Rautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation.
				<i class="calibre2">Have I failed utterly?</i> he asked himself.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6664">
				Feyd-Rautha tried not to walk too swiftly. He felt the skin crawling on

				His muscles alternately tensed and relaxed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6665">
				“Have you heard the latest word from Arrakis?” the Baron asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6666">“No, Uncle.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6667">
				Feyd-Rautha forced himself not to look back. He turned down the hall out
				of the servants’ wing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6668">
				“They’ve a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the
				Fremen,” the Baron said. “They call him Muad’Dib. Very funny, really. It

				It’ll keep them occupied.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6669">
				“That’s very interesting, Uncle,” Feyd-Rautha said. He turned into the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6672">
				They came into the Baron’s apartments through the reception salon to the
				bedchamber. Subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here&mdash;a
				suspensor lamp displaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel
				spilled open across a bedstand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6673">
				“It was a clever plan,” the Baron said. He kept his body shield tuned to
				maximum, stopped, facing his nephew. “But not clever enough. Tell me,
				Feyd, why didn’t you strike me down yourself? You’ve had opportunity
				enough.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6674">
				Feyd-Rautha found a suspensor chair, accomplished a mental shrug as he
				sat down in it without being asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6675">
				<i class="calibre2">I must be bold now,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6676">
				“You taught me that my own hands must remain clean,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6677">
				“Ah, yes,” the Baron said. “When you face the Emperor, you must be able
				to say truthfully that you did not do the deed. The witch at the
				Emperor’s elbow will hear your words and know their truth or falsehood.
				Yes. I warned you about that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6678">
				“Why haven’t you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
				“With a Truthsayer at your side&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6679">
				“You know my tastes!” the Baron snapped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6680">
				Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: “Still, one would be valuable

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6681">
				“I trust them not!” the Baron snarled. “And stop trying to change the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6682">
				Feyd-Rautha spoke mildly: “As you wish, Uncle.”

				“It’s been so long ago, Uncle. After all, I&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6686">
				“No evasions, please,” the Baron said, and the tightness of his voice
				exposed the rein on his anger.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6687">
				Feyd-Rautha looked at his uncle, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2">He knows, else he wouldn’t ask.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6688">
				“It was a sham, Uncle. I arranged it to discredit your slavemaster.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6689">
				“Very clever,” the Baron said. “Brave, too. That slave-gladiator almost

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6690">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6691">
				“If you had finesse and subtlety to match such courage, you’d be truly
				formidable.” The Baron shook his head from side to side. And as he had
				done many times since that terrible day on Arrakis, he found himself
				regretting the loss of Piter, the Mentat. There’d been a man of
				delicate, devilish subtlety. It hadn’t saved him, though. Again, the
				Baron shook his head. Fate was sometimes inscrutable.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6692">
				Feyd-Rautha glanced around the bedchamber, studying the signs of the
				struggle, wondering how his uncle had overcome the slave they’d prepared
				so carefully.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6693">
				“How did I best him?” the Baron asked, “Ah-h-h, now, Feyd&mdash;let me
				keep some weapons to preserve me in my old age. It’s better we use this
				time to strike a bargain.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6694">
				Feyd-Rautha stared at him.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir for certain, then. Else

				<span

				remained calm and reasonable, betraying none of the elation that filled
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6697">
				The Baron, too, noted the control. He nodded. “You’re good material,
				Feyd. I don’t waste good material. You persist, however, in refusing to
				learn my true value to you. You are obstinate. You do not see why I
				should be preserved as someone of the utmost value to you. This….” He
				gestured at the evidence of the struggle in the bedchamber. “This was
				foolishness. I do not reward foolishness.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6698">
				<i class="calibre2">Get to the point, you old fool!</i> Feyd-Rautha
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6699">
				“You think of me as an old fool,” the Baron said. “I must dissuade you

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6700">“You speak of a bargain.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6701">
				“Ah, the impatience of youth,” the Baron said. “Well, this is the

				And I, when you are ready for it, will step aside in your favor. I will
				retire to an advisory position, leaving you in the seat of power.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6702">“Retire, Uncle?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6703">
				“You still think me the fool,” the Baron said, “and this but confirms
				it, eh? You think I’m begging you! Step cautiously, Feyd. This old fool
				saw through the shielded needle you’d planted in that slave boy’s thigh.
				Right where I’d put my hand on it, eh? The smallest pressure
				and&mdash;snick! A poison needle in the old fool’s palm! Ah-h-h, Feyd….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6704">
				The Baron shook his head, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6706">
				Feyd-Rautha remained silent, struggling with himself.
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6707">
				“You speak of a bargain,” Feyd-Rautha said. “What pledge do we give to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6708">
				“How can we trust each other, eh?” the Baron asked. “Well, Feyd, as for
				you: I’m setting Thufir Hawat to watch over you. I trust Hawat’s Mentat
				capabilities in this. Do you understand me? And as for me, you’ll have
				to take me on faith. But I can’t live forever, can I, Feyd? And perhaps

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6709">
				“I give you my pledge and what do you give me?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6710">
				“I let you go on living,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6711">
				Again, Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He sets Hawat over me! What would he say if I told him Hawat planned

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6712">
				“Well, what do you say?” the Baron asked.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6713">
				“What can I say? I accept, of course.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6714">
				And Feyd-Rautha thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Hawat! He plays both ends against the middle…is that it? Has he moved

				<span

				>“You haven’t said anything about my setting Hawat to watch you,” the
				Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6717">
				Feyd-Rautha betrayed anger by a flaring of nostrils. The name of Hawat
				had been a danger signal in the Harkonnen family for so many years…and
				now it had a new meaning: still dangerous.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6718">
				“Hawat’s a dangerous toy,” Feyd-Rautha said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6719">
				“Toy! Don’t be stupid. I know what I have in Hawat and how to control
				it. Hawat has deep emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one
				to fear. But deep emotions…ah, now, those can be bent to your needs.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6720">
				“Uncle, I don’t understand you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6721">“Yes, that’s plain enough.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6722">
				Only a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through
				Feyd-Rautha.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6723">
				“And you do not understand Hawat,” the Baron said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6724">
				<i class="calibre2">Nor do you!</i> Feyd-Rautha thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6725">
				“Who does Hawat blame for his present circumstances?” the Baron asked.
				“Me? Certainly. But he was an Atreides tool and bested me for years
				until the Imperium took a hand. That’s how he sees it. His hate for me
				is a casual thing now. He believes he can best me anytime. Believing
				this, he is bested. For I direct his attention where I want
				it&mdash;against the Imperium.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6726">
				Tensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across Feyd-Rautha’s
				forehead, thinned his mouth. “Against the Emperor?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6727">
				<i class="calibre2">Let my dear nephew try the taste of that,</i> the

				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6729">
				Slowly, Feyd-Rautha wet his lips with his tongue. Could it be true what
				the old fool was saying? There was more here than there seemed to be.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6730">
				“And what has Hawat to do with this?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6731">
				“He thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the Emperor.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6732">
				“And when that’s accomplished?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6733">
				“He does not think beyond his revenge. Hawat’s a man who must serve
				others, and doesn’t even know this about himself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6734">
				“I’ve learned much from Hawat,” Feyd-Rautha agreed, and felt the truth
				of the words as he spoke them. “But the more I learn, the more I feel we
				should dispose of him…and soon.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6735">
				“You don’t like the idea of his watching you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6736">“Hawat watches everybody.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6737">
				“And he may put you on a throne. Hawat is subtle. He is dangerous,
				devious. But I’ll not yet withhold the antidote from him. A sword is
				dangerous, too, Feyd. We have the scabbard for this one, though. The
				poison’s in him. When we withdraw the antidote, death will sheathe him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6738">
				“In a way, it’s like the arena,” Feyd-Rautha said. “Feints within feints
				within feints. You watch to see which way the gladiator leans, which way
				he looks, how he holds his knife.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6739">
				He nodded to himself, seeing that these words pleased his uncle, but
				thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!</i

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6744">
				“And now,” the Baron said, “we will go down to the slave quarters, we

				“What are Rabban’s troop losses for the past two years?” Hawat asked.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6803">
				“By your own count,” Hawat said, “he killed fifteen thousand over two

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6804">
				The Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: “This is your job, Mentat.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6805">
				“I gave you Duncan Idaho’s head count on the sietch he visited,” Hawat

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6806">“Ten million?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6807">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6811">
				“We haven’t even cut heavily into their birth-rate-growth figure,” Hawat

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6812">
				“Salusa Secundus!” the Baron barked. “What has this to do with the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6813">
				“A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6814">
				“Nonsense! By your argument, <i class="calibre2">I</i> could recruit

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6815">
				Hawat spoke in a mild voice: “Don’t you oppress any of your troops?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6816">“Well…I…but&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6817">
				“Oppression is a relative thing,” Hawat said. “Your fighting men are
				much better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant
				alternative to being soldiers of the Baron, heh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6818">
				The Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities&mdash;had

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6819">
				Presently he said: “How could you be sure of the loyalty of such
				recruits?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6820">
				“I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength,”

				superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine
				mansions…whatever they desired.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6822">
				The Baron began to nod. “The way the Sardaukar live at home.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6823">
				“The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa

				as that of any member of a Great House.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6824">
				“Such an idea!” the Baron whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6825">
				“You begin to share my suspicions,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6826">
				“Where did such a thing start?” the Baron asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6827">
				“Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6828">

				“Count Fenring!” the Baron blurted.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6841">
				“He became too familiar, too demanding of me,” the Baron said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6842">
				“You assure me you don’t waste a useful man,” Hawat said. “Will you

				“One moment,” the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his
				great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6848">
				Hawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. “So that’s why they started

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6849">
				“But certainly my innocent suggestion that&mdash;”

				“Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6852">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6868">
				The Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6871">
				“It fits,” the Baron said. “But I can feel myself tiring of all this.
				I’m preparing another to take over Arrakis for me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6872">
				Hawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6874">
				And Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled

				Paul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani standing beneath the
				yellow globes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe
				with hood thrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She
				had been sheathing her crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away
				down the corridor with a burden.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6901">
				And Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they’re

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6902">
				Chani’s water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck,
				tinkled as she turned toward him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6903">
				“Chani, what is this?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6904">
				“I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6905">
				“<i class="calibre2">You</i> killed him?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6906">
				“Yes. But perhaps I should’ve left him for Harah.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6907">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6916">
				“He was not worthy, Usul,” Chani said. “I’d not disturb your meditations
				with the likes of him.” She moved closer, looking at him out of the
				corners of her eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear.
				“And, beloved, when it’s learned that a challenger may face

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6917">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6919">

				<i class="calibre2">It’s the spice meal.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6920">
				Still, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered if it
				might be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the
				world where the Fremen believed he had his true existence&mdash;into the
				alam al-mithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where
				all physical limitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought
				of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all
				points of reference. In the landscape of a myth he could not orient
				himself and say: “I am I because I am here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6921">
				His mother had said once: “The people are divided, some of them, in how
				they think of you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6922">
				<i class="calibre2">I must be waking from the dream,</i> Paul told

				>the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of the Fremen, these
				words had passed through reality.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6924">
				Jessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and
				the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn’t like the fact that people of both
				sietch and graben referred to Muad’Dib as
				<i class="calibre2">Him.</i> And she went questioning among the tribes,
				sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding
				on them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6925">
				She had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: “When religion and
				politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand
				in their way. Their movement becomes headlong&mdash;faster and faster
				and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a
				precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it’s too
				late.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6926">
				Paul recalled that he had sat there in his mother’s quarters, in the
				inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by
				woven patterns out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her
				out, noting the way she was always observing&mdash;even when her eyes
				were lowered. Her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the
				mouth, but the hair was still like polished bronze. The wide-set green
				eyes, though, hid beneath their overcasting of spice-imbued blue.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6927">
				“The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6928">
				“Nothing about religion is simple,” she warned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6929">
				But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found
				himself swayed by anger. He could only say: “Religion unifies our
				forces. It’s our mystique.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6933">
				But she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been
				the day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had
				understood some of the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his
				liaison&mdash;the “marriage of youth”&mdash;with Chani. But Chani had
				produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had found herself unable to reject
				the child with the mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6934">
				Jessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: “You think me an
				unnatural mother.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6935">“Of course not.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6936">
				“I see the way you watch me when I’m with your sister. You don’t

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6937">
				“I know why Alia is different,” he said. “She was unborn, part of you,

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6938">“You know nothing of it!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6939">
				And Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its
				time, said only: “I don’t think you unnatural.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6940">
				She saw his distress, said: “There is a thing, Son.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6941">“Yes?”</p>

				“I do love your Chani. I accept her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6943">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6944">
				The reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality
				began to dip through the dream state
				<span

				>into his awareness. He knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg, a desert

				That could only mean Chani was nearby&mdash;Chani, his soul, Chani his
				sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the
				deep south.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6946">

				He felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6968">
				It was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6969">
				“You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see

				Quietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6971">
				She spoke from the tent’s gloom, another shadow there: “It’s not yet

				He began tightening his stillsuit. “You told me once the words of the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6976">
				“I am the mother of thy firstborn,” she agreed.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6977">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6978">
				He recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: “The

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6979">
				She slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. “Today, I

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6980">
				“You should’ve left this duty to another,” he said.

				He kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned

				Paul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and

				He thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom&mdash;the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6988">
				Yet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing
				that he had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6989">He had not ridden the maker.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6990">
				Oh, he’d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he
				had not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the

				thumpers beyond the erg&mdash;were denied him unless he ordered a
				palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one of the sick and
				wounded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6991">
				Memory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during
				the night. He saw a strange parallel here&mdash;if he mastered the
				maker, his rule was strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this
				carried its own measure of command. But beyond them both lay the clouded
				area, the Great Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-6994">
				Chani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him

				“Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul,” she said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7011">
				“You should conserve your energies for the test,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7012">
				He saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal
				in her voice. “The unknown brings its own worries,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7013">
				Presently she nodded, said, “There is yet…misunderstanding because of
				Alia’s strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more

				not understand the…change in the womb that made Alia…different.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7014">
				“There is trouble?” he asked. And he thought:

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7017">
				“And what did my mother say to them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7018">
				“She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: ‘If Alia
				incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7019">
				<i class="calibre2">There will be trouble because of Alia,</i> he

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7020">
				A crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face,
				bringing the scent of the pre-spice mass. “El-Sayal, the rain of sand

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7021">
				He looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7029">
				Paul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7030">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7031">
				He knew this was among the alternatives today, a
				<i class="calibre2">fact</i> along lines of the future radiating from
				this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued him. The more
				he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the
				jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His
				entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a
				chasm&mdash;the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7032">
				“Stilgar approaches,” Chani said. “I must stand apart now, beloved. Now,
				I must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly
				in the Chronicles.” She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve
				slipped, then she had herself under control. “When this is past, I shall
				prepare thy breakfast with my own hands,” she said. She turned away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7033">
				Stilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, stirring up little dust
				puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their
				untamed stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the
				lines of craggy cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock
				for all their movement.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7036">
				Stilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to
				his sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul
				thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from
				the spice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7037">
				“They denied us the Hajj,” Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7038">
				As Chani had taught him, Paul responded: “Who can deny a Fremen the
				right to walk or ride where he wills?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7039">
				“I am a Naib,” Stilgar said, “never to be taken alive. I am a leg of the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7040">Silence settled over them.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7041">
				Paul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar,
				the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer.
				And he thought of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of
				killing, an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their
				days, never once considering what might take the place of
				either&mdash;except for a dream with which Liet-Kynes had infused them
				before his death.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7042">
				“Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?”
				Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7043">
				“He is ever with us,” the Fremen chanted.

				>Stilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his
				voice. “Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and
				directly&mdash;nothing fancy. Among our people, we ride the maker at the
				age of twelve. You are more than six years beyond that age and not born
				to this life. You don’t have to impress anyone with your courage. We
				know you are brave. All you must do is call the maker and ride him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7046">“I will remember,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7047">
				“See that you do. I’ll not have you shame my teaching.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7048">
				Stilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe.
				The thing was pointed at one end, had a spring-wound clapper at the
				other end. “I prepared this thumper myself. It’s a good one. Take it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7049">
				Paul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7050">
				“Shishakli has your hooks,” Stilgar said. “He’ll hand them to you as you
				step out onto that dune over there.” He pointed to his right. “Call a
				big maker, Usul. Show us the way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7051">
				Paul marked the tone of Stilgar’s voice&mdash;half ritual and half that
				of a worried friend.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7052">
				In that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took
				on the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme
				heat and dryness even for Arrakis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7053">
				“It is the time of the scalding day,” Stilgar said, and now his voice
				was entirely ritual. “Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a
				leader of men.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7054">
				Paul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply
				now that the dawn wind had died.

				>He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated&mdash;a dirty tan slope
				with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving out in the
				opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their
				camp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7056">
				One robed figure remained in Paul’s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of
				the Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap
				and mask.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7057">
				Shishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The
				shafts were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods
				at one end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7058">
				Paul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7059">
				“They are my own hooks,” Shishakli said in a husky voice. “They never
				have failed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7060">
				Paul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and
				up the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop
				scattering like a flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood
				alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him, the
				flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen,
				higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7061">
				Stooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the
				sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming.
				Then he hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death
				necessities that faced him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7062">
				When he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the
				sand, a giant worm&mdash;a maker&mdash;would hear and come to the
				drumming. With the whiplike
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7063"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="633"></span
				>hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker’s high curving back.
				For as long as a forward edge of a worm’s ring segment was held open by
				a hook, open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior,
				the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact,
				roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the
				desert surface as possible.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7064">
				<i class="calibre2">I am a sandrider,</i> Paul told himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7065">
				He glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only
				to shift those hooks down the curve of a maker’s immense side to make
				the creature roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it
				done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in
				training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and
				quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7066">
				Once he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the
				twenty-thumper journey into the southland&mdash;to rest and restore
				himself&mdash;into the south where the women and the families had been
				hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7067">
				He lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the
				maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one
				who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7068">
				“You must gauge the approaching maker carefully,” Stilgar had explained.
				“You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not
				so close that it engulfs you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7069">
				With abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper’s latch. The clapper
				began revolving and the summons
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7070"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="634"></span
				>drummed through the sand, a measured “lump…lump…lump….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7071">
				He straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar’s words:
				“Judge the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an
				unseen approach to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it
				before you see it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7072">
				And Chani’s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him
				overcame her, filled his mind: “When you take your stand along the
				maker’s path, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch
				of sand. Hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very
				essence.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7073">
				Slowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had
				been taught.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7074">
				It came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently
				he saw the faraway outline of the creature’s track against the dawnlight
				and realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of
				one this size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the
				rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a
				mountain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7075">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>This is nothing I have seen by vision or in life,</i
				>
				Paul cautioned himself. He hurried across the path of the thing to take
				his stand, caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment.

				<i class="calibre2">And Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7082">
				Jessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between
				the night’s classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the
				one she had enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom.
				Still, this place had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low
				coffee table near at hand, multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft
				yellow glowglobes overhead. The room was permeated with the distinctive
				acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that she had come to associate with
				a sense of security.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7083">
				Yet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7084"

					title="636"></span
				>being in an alien place. It was the harshness that the rugs and
				hangings attempted to conceal.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7085">
				A faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber.
				Jessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay’s. Her time was
				near. And Jessica knew she’d see the baby soon enough&mdash;a blue-eyed
				cherub brought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that
				her daughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7086">
				It was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn’t
				have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned
				the slave raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7087">
				Jessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son
				and the dangers he faced&mdash;the pit traps with their poisoned barbs,
				the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen
				took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had
				given them), and the natural dangers of the desert&mdash;makers and
				thirst and dust chasms.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7088">
				She thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that
				ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well
				they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet,
				how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything
				the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7089">
				A dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a
				cup upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced
				coffee.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7090">
				<i class="calibre2">An offering from the birth celebration,</i> Jessica
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7091">
				She took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself.
				<span

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7093">
				She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its
				contents&mdash;hot and delicious.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7094">
				And she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for
				her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to
				deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love
				had sent the gift&mdash;with only a slight tinge of fear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7095">
				Another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she
				had thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of
				telepathy here, she knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch
				community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they
				shared. The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the
				enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained
				and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand
				or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single
				organism.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7104">
				The voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7105">“Yes, Harah.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7106">
				The hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore
				sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to
				the shoulders. Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back
				like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head. The
				jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7107">
				Behind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7108">
				Seeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia’s
				resemblance to Paul at that age&mdash;the same wide-eyed solemnity to
				her questing look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were
				subtle differences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia
				disquieting. The child&mdash;little more than a toddler&mdash;carried
				herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years. Adults were
				shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words between the
				sexes. Or they’d catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice,
				still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover in her
				words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no
				two-year-old had ever encountered.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7111">
				“Alia.” Jessica motioned to her daughter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7112">
				The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped
				her mother’s hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness
				they had shared since before Alia’s birth. It wasn’t a matter of shared
				thoughts&mdash;although there were bursts of that if they touched while
				Jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony. It was something
				larger, an immediate awareness of another living spark, a sharp and
				poignant thing, a nerve-<i class="calibre2">simpatico</i> that made them
				emotionally one.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7113">
				In the formal manner that befitted a member of her son’s household,
				Jessica said: “Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7114">
				With the same traditional formality, she said: “Subakh un nar. I am
				well.” The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7115">
				Jessica sensed amusement from Alia.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7116">
				“My brother’s ghanima is annoyed with me,” Alia said in her half-lisp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7117">
				Jessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah&mdash;ghanima. In
				the subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant “something acquired
				in battle” and with the added overtone that the something no longer was
				used for its original purpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a
				curtain weight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7118">
				Harah scowled at the child. “Don’t try to insult me, child. I know my
				place.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7119">
				“What have you done this time, Alia?” Jessica asked.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7122">
				“I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay’s child being born,” Alia
				said. “It’s a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he’d
				cried long enough&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7123">
				“She came out and touched him,” Harah said, “and he stopped crying.
				Everyone knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he’s
				in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7124">
				“He’d cried enough,” Alia said. “I just wanted to feel his spark, his
				life. That’s all. And when he felt me he didn’t want to cry anymore.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7125">
				“It’s just made more talk among the people,” Harah said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7126">
				“Subiay’s boy is healthy?” Jessica asked. She saw that something was
				troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7127">
				“Healthy as any mother could ask,” Harah said. “They know Alia didn’t
				hurt him. They didn’t so much mind her touching him. He settled down
				right away and was happy. I was….” Harah shrugged.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7128">
				“It’s the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?” Jessica asked. “It’s

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7129">
				“How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?” Harah
				demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7130">
				“But he does!” Alia said. “Subiay’s boy looks just like the son of Mitha

				“It’s not just the things she says,” Harah said. “It’s the exercises,

				beside her nose, or a muscle on the back of a finger, or&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7136">
				“Those are the Bene Gesserit training,” Jessica said. “You know that,
				Harah. Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7137">
				“Reverend Mother, you know these things don’t matter to me,” Harah said.
				“It’s the people and the way they mutter. I feel danger in it. They say
				your daughter’s a demon, that other children refuse to play with her,
				that she’s&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7138">
				“She has so little in common with the other children,” Jessica said.
				“She’s no demon. It’s just the&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7139">“Of course she’s not!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7140">
				Jessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah’s tone,
				glanced down at Alia. The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a
				sense of…waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7141">
				“I respect the fact that you’re a member of my son’s household,” Jessica
				said. (Alia stirred against her hand.) “You may speak openly with me of
				whatever’s troubling you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7142">
				“I will not be a member of your son’s household much longer,” Harah
				said. “I’ve waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special

				<span

				I don’t share your son’s bed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7144">
				Again Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7145">
				“You’d have made a good companion for my son, though,” Jessica said. And
				she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her:
				<i class="calibre2">Companion…not a wife.</i> Jessica’s thoughts went
				then straight to the center, to the pang that came from the common talk
				in the sietch that her son’s companionship with Chani had become a
				permanent thing, the marriage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7146">
				<i class="calibre2">I love Chani,</i> Jessica thought, but she reminded
				herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity. Royal
				marriages had other reasons than love.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7147">
				“You think I don’t know what you plan for your son?” Harah asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7148">
				“What do you mean?” Jessica demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7149">
				“You plan to unite the tribes under <i class="calibre2">Him</i>,” Harah
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7150">“Is that bad?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7151">
				“I see danger for him…and Alia is part of that danger.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7152">
				Alia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7153">
				“I’ve watched you two together,” Harah said, “the way you touch. And
				Alia is like my own flesh because she’s sister to one who is like my
				brother. I’ve watched over her and guarded her from the time she was a
				mere baby, from the time of the razzia when we fled here. I’ve seen many
				things about her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7154">
				Jessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7155">
				“You know what I mean,” Harah said. “The way she
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7156"

					title="643"></span
				>knew from the first what we were saying to her. When has there been
				another baby who knew the water discipline so young? What other baby’s
				first words to her nurse were: ‘I love you, Harah’?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7157">
				Harah stared at Alia. “Why do you think I accept her insults? I know
				there’s no malice in them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7158">Alia looked up at her mother.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7159">
				“Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother,” Harah said. “I could
				have been of the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7160">
				“Harah….” Jessica shrugged. “I don’t know what to say.” And she felt
				surprise at herself, because this literally was true.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7161">
				Alia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of
				waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7162">
				“We made a mistake,” Alia said. “Now we need Harah.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7163">
				“It was the ceremony of the seed,” Harah said, “when you changed the
				Water of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7164">
				<i class="calibre2">Need Harah?</i> Jessica asked herself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7165">
				“Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand
				me?” Alia asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7166">
				“What would you have her do?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7167">
				“She already knows what to do,” Alia said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7168">
				“I will tell them the truth,” Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old
				and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the
				sharp features. “I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little
				girl, that she has never been a little girl.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7169">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7170"

					title="644"></span
				>Alia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the
				wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7171">
				“I know I’m a freak,” Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from
				the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7172">
				“You’re not a freak!” Harah snapped. “Who dared say you’re a freak?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7173">
				Again, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah’s
				voice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly&mdash;they did
				need Harah. The tribe would understand Harah&mdash;both her words and
				her emotions&mdash;for it was obvious she loved Alia as though this were
				her own child.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7174">
				“Who said it?” Harah repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7175">“Nobody.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7176">
				Alia used a corner of Jessica’s aba to wipe the tears from her face. She
				smoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7177">
				“Then don’t you say it,” Harah ordered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7178">“Yes, Harah.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7179">
				“Now,” Harah said, “you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell
				the others. Tell me what it is that happened to you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7180">
				Alia swallowed, looked up at her mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7181">Jessica nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7182">
				“One day I woke up,” Alia said. “It was like waking from sleep except
				that I could not remember going to sleep. I was in a warm, dark place.
				And I was frightened.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7183">
				Listening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered
				that day in the big cavern.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7184">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7185"

					title="645"></span
				>“When I was frightened,” Alia said, “I tried to escape, but there was
				no way to escape. Then I saw a spark…but it wasn’t exactly like seeing
				it. The spark was just there with me and I felt the spark’s
				emotions…soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything
				would be all right. That was my mother.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7186">
				Harah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a
				look of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though
				they, too, were trying to hear Alia’s words.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7187">
				And Jessica thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>What do we really know of how such a one thinks…out of her unique
					experiences and training and ancestry?</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7188">
				“Just when I felt safe and reassured,” Alia said, “there was another
				spark with us…and everything was happening at once. The other spark was
				the old Reverend Mother. She was…trading lives with my
				mother…everything…and I was there with them, seeing it all…everything.
				And it was over, and I was them and all the others and myself…only it
				took me a long time to find myself again. There were so many others.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7189">
				“It was a cruel thing,” Jessica said. “No being should wake into
				consciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that
				happened to you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7190">
				“I couldn’t do anything else!” Alia said. “I didn’t know how to reject
				or hide my consciousness…or shut it off…everything just
				happened…everything….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7191">
				“We didn’t know,” Harah murmured. “When we gave your mother the Water to
				change, we didn’t know you existed within her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7192">
				“Don’t be sad about it, Harah,” Alia said. “I shouldn’t
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7193"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="646"></span
				>feel sorry for myself. After all, there’s cause for happiness here: I’m
				a Reverend Mother. The tribe has two Rev….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7194">
				She broke off, tipping her head to listen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7195">
				Harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at
				Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessica’s face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7196">
				“Didn’t you suspect?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7197">“Sh-h-h-h,” Alia said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7198">
				A distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that
				separated them from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying
				distinct sounds now: “Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya!
				Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7199">
				The chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through
				to the inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7200">
				When the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the
				sadness in her voice: “It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7201">
				“My family sat in their pool courtyard,” Harah said, “in air bathed by
				the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree
				of portyguls, round and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket
				with mish-mish and baklawa and mugs of liban&mdash;all manner of good
				things to eat. In our gardens and in our flocks, there was peace…peace
				in all the land.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7202">
				“Life was full with happiness until the raiders came,” Alia said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7203">
				“Blood ran cold at the scream of friends,” Jessica said. And she felt
				the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she
				shared.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7204">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7205"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="647"></span
				>“La, la, la, the women cried,” said Harah.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7206">
				“The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives
				dripping red from the lives of our men,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7207">
				Silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of
				the sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus
				fresh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7208">
				Presently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the
				words a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7209">
				“We will never forgive and we will never forget,” Harah said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7210">
				In the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering
				of people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing
				beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7211">“Reverend Mother?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7212">
				A woman’s voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one
				of Stilgar’s wives.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7213">“What is it, Tharthar?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7214">
				“There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7215">
				Jessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul.
				“Paul…” she gasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7216">
				Tharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed
				a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked
				up at Tharthar&mdash;a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black,
				the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of
				her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7217">
				“What is it?” Jessica demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7218">
				“There is word from the sand,” Tharthar said. “Usul
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7219"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="648"></span
				>meets the maker for his test…it is today. The young men say he cannot
				fail, he will be a sandrider by nightfall. The young men are banding for
				a razzia. They will raid in the north and meet Usul there. They say they
				will raise the cry then. They say they will force him to call out
				Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7220">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Gathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but
					surely&mdash;these are no longer enough,</i
				>
				Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The little raids, the certain raids&mdash;these are no longer enough
					now that Paul and I have trained them. They feel their power. They
					want to fight.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7221">
				Tharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7222">
				<i class="calibre2">We know the need for cautious waiting,</i> Jessica
				thought,
				<i class="calibre2"
					>but there’s the core of our frustration. We know also the harm that
					waiting extended too long can do us. We lose our senses of purpose if
					the waiting’s prolonged.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7223">
				“The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be
				afraid,” Tharthar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7224">She lowered her gaze.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7225">
				“So that’s the way of it,” Jessica muttered. And she thought:
				<i class="calibre2">Well I saw it coming. As did Stilgar.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7226">
				Again, Tharthar cleared her throat. “Even my brother, Shoab, says it,”
				she said. “They will leave Usul no choice.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7227">
				<i class="calibre2">Then it has come,</i> Jessica thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>And Paul will have to handle it himself. The Reverend Mother dare not
					become involved in the succession.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7228">
				Alia freed her hand from her mother’s, said: “I will go with Tharthar
				and listen to the young men. Perhaps there is a way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7229">
				<span

				>Jessica met Tharthar’s gaze, but spoke to Alia: “Go, then. And report
				to me as soon as you can.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7231">
				“We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother,” Tharthar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7232">
				“We do not want it,” Jessica agreed. “The tribe needs
				<i class="calibre2">all</i> its strength.” She glanced at Harah. “Will
				you go with them?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7233">
				Harah answered the unspoken part of the question: “Tharthar will allow
				no harm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she
				and I, to share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I.” Harah
				looked up at Tharthar, back to Jessica. “We have an understanding.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7234">
				Tharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: “We must hurry. The young men
				are leaving.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7235">
				They pressed through the hangings, the child’s hand in the small woman’s
				hand, but the child seemed to be leading.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7236">
				“If Paul-Muad’Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe,” Harah
				said. “Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have
				changed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7237">
				“Times have changed for you, as well,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7238">
				“You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle,” Harah said.
				“Usul could not but win.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7239">
				“That was my meaning,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7240">
				“And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment,” Harah said.
				She shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. “How wrong you
				are. Perhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of
				Usul, that I am jealous of Chani?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7241">
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7243">“I pity Chani,” Harah said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7244">
				Jessica stiffened. “What do you mean?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7245">
				“I know what you think of Chani,” Harah said. “You think she is not the
				wife for your son.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7246">
				Jessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. “Perhaps.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7247">
				“You could be right,” Harah said. “If you are, you may find a surprising

				<i class="calibre2">Him.</i>”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7248">
				Jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. “Chani’s very

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7249">
				“Your rugs are very dirty in here,” Harah said. She swept her gaze
				around the floor, avoiding Jessica’s eyes. “So many people tramping

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7255">
				The thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the
				friction-hissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the
				cavern-circle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower. The spice
				odor from it dominated the air.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7256">
				Paul’s stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware
				of his nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar’s teaching, the
				painstaking hours on the sand, overshadowed all else.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7257">

				>“How far outside the maker’s radius must you stand in pea sand?”
				Stilgar had asked him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7259">
				And he had answered correctly: “Half a meter for every meter of the
				maker’s diameter.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7260">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7261">
				“To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and
				mount it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7262">
				“You’ve ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life,”
				Stilgar had said. “But what you’ll summon for your test is a wild maker,
				an old man of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7263">
				Now the thumper’s deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching
				worm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even
				through his filters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed
				almost on him. Its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would
				sweep across his knees.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7264">
				<i class="calibre2">Come up, you lovely monster,</i> he thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Up. You hear me calling. Come up. Come up.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7265">
				The wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied
				himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving
				wall, that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7266">
				Paul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite
				and pull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning
				out against the clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the
				testing: if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a
				ring segment, opening the segment, the worm would not roll down and
				crush him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7267">
				The worm slowed. It glided across the thumper,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7268"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="653"></span
				>silencing it. Slowly, it began to roll&mdash;up, up&mdash;bringing
				those irritant barbs as high as possible, away from the sand that
				threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7269">
				Paul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like
				an emperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort
				there, to turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7270">
				Suddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young
				men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their
				backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could
				spill them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7271">
				Leaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower
				down the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down
				the first one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and
				as it rolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the
				others waited.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7272">
				Paul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the
				sensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a
				triple line behind him, steadied against their hooks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7273">
				Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul’s
				hooks, glanced up at Paul’s smiling face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7274">
				“You did it, eh?” Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of
				their passage. “That’s what you think? You did it?” He straightened.
				“Now I tell you that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who
				do better. There was drumsand to your left where you waited. You could
				not retreat there if the worm turned that way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7275">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7276"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="654"></span
				>The smile slipped from Paul’s face. “I saw the drumsand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7277">
				“Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary
				to you? It was a thing you could do even in the test.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7278">
				Paul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7279">
				“You think it bad of me to say this now,” Stilgar said. “It is my duty.
				I think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that
				drumsand, the maker would’ve turned toward you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7280">
				In spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It
				took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received
				from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. “I apologize,”
				he said. “It will not happen again.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7281">
				“In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take
				the maker if you cannot,” Stilgar said. “Remember that we work together.
				That way, we’re certain. We work together, eh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7282">He slapped Paul’s shoulder.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7283">
				“We work together,” Paul agreed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7284">
				“Now,” Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, “show me you know how to
				handle a maker. Which side are we on?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7285">
				Paul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted
				the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to
				his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved
				characteristically with one side up more frequently. As it grew older,
				the characteristic up-side became an almost constant thing. Bottom
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7286"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="655"></span
				>scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales could be told by size
				alone on a big worm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7287">
				Shifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to
				open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as
				it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the
				line and into positions ahead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7288">
				“Ach, haiiiii-yoh!” he shouted in the traditional call. The left-side
				steersman opened a ring segment there.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7289">
				In a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment.
				Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul
				shouted: “Geyrat!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7290">
				The steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight
				course.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7291">
				Stilgar said, “Very good, Paul-Muad’Dib. With plenty of practice, you
				may yet become a sandrider.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7292">
				Paul frowned, thinking: <i class="calibre2">Was I not first up?</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7293">
				From behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting,
				flinging his name against the sky.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7294">
				“Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7295">
				And far to the rear along the worm’s surface, Paul heard the beat of the
				goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed.
				Their robes flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage
				increased.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7296">
				Paul looked back through the troop, found Chani’s face among them. He
				looked at her as he spoke to Stilgar. “Then I am a sandrider, Stil?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7297">
				“Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7298">
				“Then I may choose our destination?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7299">“That’s the way of it.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7300">
				<span

				no life before this day. I was as a child until this day.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7302">
				“Not quite a child,” Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood
				where the wind was whipping it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7303">
				“But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been
				pulled.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7304">“There is no cork.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7305">
				“I would go south, Stilgar&mdash;twenty thumpers. I would see this land
				we make, this land that I’ve only seen through the eyes of others.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7306">

				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7307">
				Stilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his
				attention on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also
				the excitement his words had kindled in the troop.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7308">
				“The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks,” Stilgar
				said. “The sinks are only a thumper away.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7309">
				“The Fedaykin have raided with me,” Paul said. “They’ll raid with me
				again until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7310">
				Stilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing
				this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the
				Tabr sietch and to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that
				Liet-Kynes was dead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7311">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen</i

			</p>

				<span

					id="calibre_link-7313"

				>“Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7314">
				Eyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode,
				and they watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani’s glance, the
				way she looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul-Muad’Dib, who
				was her mate.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7315">
				“You cannot guess what I want,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7316">
				And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>I cannot back down. I must hold control over these people.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7317">
				“You are mudir of the sandride this day,” Stilgar said. Cold formality
				rang in his voice: “How do you use this power?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7318">
				<i class="calibre2">We need time to relax, time for cool reflection,</i>
				Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7319">
				“We shall go south,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7320">
				“Even if I say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7321">
				“We shall go south,” Paul repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7322">
				A sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe
				tightly around him. “There will be a Gathering,” he said. “I will send
				the messages.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7323">
				<i class="calibre2">He thinks I will call him out,</i> Paul thought.
				<i class="calibre2">And he knows he cannot stand against me.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7324">
				Paul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking
				of the necessities that went into his decisions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7325">
				<i class="calibre2">They do not know how it is,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7326">
				But he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to
				remain on the central line of the time storm he could see in the future.
				There would
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7328">
				<i class="calibre2">I will not call him out if it can be helped</i>, he
				thought.
				<i class="calibre2">If there’s another way to prevent the jihad….</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7329">
				“We’ll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath
				Habbanya Ridge,” Stilgar said. He steadied himself with one hook against
				the swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising
				out of the desert.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7330">
				Paul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like
				waves. No green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it
				stretched the way to the southern desert&mdash;a course of at least ten
				days and nights, as fast as they could goad the makers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7331">Twenty thumpers.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7332">
				The way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be.
				The dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there’d be a faint
				change of color on the far horizon&mdash;such a slight change that he
				might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes&mdash;and there would be
				the new sietch.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7333">
				“Does my decision suit Muad’Dib?” Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch
				of sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every
				tone in a bird’s cry or a cielago’s piping message, heard the sarcasm
				and watched Paul to see what he would do.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7334">
				“Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the
				Fedaykin,” Paul said. “My death commandos know I spoke with honor. Does
				Stilgar doubt it?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7335">
				Real pain exposed itself in Paul’s voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered
				his gaze.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7336">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7337"

				>“Usul, the companion of my sietch, him I would never doubt,” Stilgar
				said. “But you are Paul-Muad’Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the
				Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. These men I don’t even
				know.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7338">
				Paul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert.
				The maker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry
				them almost twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He
				knew it. There was nothing outside the stories told to children that
				could match this old man of the desert. It was the stuff of a new
				legend, Paul realized.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7339">A hand gripped his shoulder.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7340">
				Paul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it&mdash;the dark
				eyes of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7341">
				“The one who led Tabr sietch before me,” Stilgar said, “he was my
				friend. We shared dangers. He owed me his life many a time…and I owed
				him mine.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7342">
				“I am your friend, Stilgar,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7343">
				“No man doubts it,” Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. “It’s
				the way.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7344">
				Paul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the
				possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead
				hands of his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a
				leader died in the desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7345">
				“We should leave this maker in deep sand,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7346">
				“Yes,” Stilgar agreed. “We could walk to the cave from here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7347">
				“We’ve ridden him far enough that he’ll bury himself and sulk for a day
				or so,” Paul said.
			</p>

				broke off, stared at the eastern sky.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7350">
				Paul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear
				dark, a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing
				stood out in sharp contrast.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7351">Ornithopter!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7352">
				“One small ’thopter,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7353">
				“Could be a scout,” Paul said. “Do you think they’ve seen us?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7354">
				“At this distance we’re just a worm on the surface,” Stilgar said. He
				motioned with his left hand. “Off. Scatter on the sand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7355">
				The troop began working down the worm’s sides, dropping off, blending
				with the sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped.
				Presently, only he and Stilgar remained.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7356">
				“First up, last off,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7357">
				Stilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the
				sand. Paul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area,
				then released his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not
				completely exhausted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7358">
				Freed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the
				sand. Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment
				carefully and leaped off. He landed running, lunged against the slipface
				of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the
				cascade of sand over his robe.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7359">Now, the waiting….</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7360">
				Paul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a
				<span

				>crease in his robe. He imagined the others back along their path doing
				the same.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7362">
				He heard the beat of the ’thopter’s wings before he saw it. There was a
				whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a
				broad arc toward the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7363">
				An unmarked ’thopter, Paul noted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7364">
				It flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7365">
				A bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7366">
				Paul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures
				stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani
				and Stilgar among them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7367">
				Stilgar signaled toward the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7368">
				They gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a
				broken rhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside
				Paul along the windpacked crest of a dune.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7369">
				“It was a smuggler craft,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7370">
				“So it seemed,” Paul said. “But this is deep into the desert for
				smugglers.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7371">
				“They’ve their difficulties with patrols, too,” Stilgar said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7374">

				<span class="dropcaps">T</span>he smuggler’s spice factory with its
				parent carrier and ring of drone ornithopters came over a lifting of
				dunes like a swarm of insects following its queen. Ahead of the swarm
				lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the desert floor like
				small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the ridge were
				swept clean by a recent storm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7386">
				In the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward,
				adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape.
				Beyond the ridge, he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow,
				and he gave the signal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to
				investigate.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7387">
				The ’thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke
				away from the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the
				area with its detectors dangling close to the surface.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7388">
				Almost immediately, it went through the wing-tucked dip and circle that
				told the waiting factory that spice had been found.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7389">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-7390"

					title="664"></span
				>Gurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal.
				He liked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection.
				This was deep in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush…still….
				Gurney signaled for a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent
				reserves to take up station in pattern around the area&mdash;not too
				high because then they could be seen from afar by Harkonnen detectors.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7391">
				He doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This
				was still Fremen country.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7392">
				Gurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless
				out here. Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs.
				He rubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it
				would be safest to lead a ground party through the ridge. Inspection on
				foot was still the most certain. You couldn’t be too careful when Fremen
				and Harkonnen were at each other’s throats.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7393">
				It was Fremen that worried him here. They didn’t mind trading for all
				the spice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you
				stepped foot where they forbade you to go. And they were so devilishly
				cunning of late.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7394">
				It annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these
				natives. They displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything
				he had ever encountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in
				the universe then seasoned in battles where only the superior few
				survived.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7395">
				Again Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7396"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="665"></span
				>he felt uneasy. Perhaps it was the worm they had seen…but that was on
				the other side of the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7397">
				A head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney&mdash;the factory
				commander, a one-eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and
				milky teeth of a spice diet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7398">
				“Looks like a rich patch, sir,” the factory commander said. “Shall I
				take ’er in?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7399">
				“Come down at the edge of that ridge,” Gurney ordered. “Let me disembark
				with my men. You can tractor out to the spice from there. We’ll have a
				look at that rock.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7400">“Aye.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7401">
				“In case of trouble,” Gurney said, “save the factory. We’ll lift in the
				’thopters.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7402">
				The factory commander saluted. “Aye, sir.” He popped back down through
				the hatch.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7403">
				Again Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to respect the possibility that
				there were Fremen here and he was trespassing. Fremen worried him, their
				toughness and unpredictability. Many things about this business worried
				him, but the rewards were great. The fact that he couldn’t send spotters
				high overhead worried him, too. The necessity of radio silence added to
				his uneasiness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7404">
				The factory crawler turned, began to descend. Gently it glided down to
				the dry beach at the foot of the ridge. Treads touched sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7405">
				Gurney opened the bubble dome, released his safety straps. The instant
				the factory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him,
				scrambling out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond
				the
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7406"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="666"></span
				>emergency netting. The five men of his personal guard were out with
				him, emerging from the nose hatch. Others released the factory’s carrier
				wing. It detached, lifted away to fly in a parking circle low overhead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7407">
				Immediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the
				ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7408">
				A ’thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and
				another. They disgorged Gurney’s platoon and lifted to hoverflight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7409">
				Gurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching. He left the
				filter mask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater
				need&mdash;the carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands.
				He began climbing up into the rocks, checking the terrain&mdash;pebbles
				and pea sand underfoot, the smell of spice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7410">
				<i class="calibre2">Good site for an emergency base</i>, he thought.
				Might be sensible to bury a few supplies here.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7411">
				He glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him. Good
				men, even the new ones he hadn’t had time to test. Good men. Didn’t have
				to be told every time what to do. Not a shield glimmer showed on any of
				them. No cowards in this bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a
				worm could sense the field and come to rob them of the spice they found.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7412">
				From this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice
				patch about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near
				edge. He glanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude&mdash;not
				too high. He nodded to himself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7413">
				In that instant, the ridge erupted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7414">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7415"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="667"></span
				>Twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering ’thopters
				and carrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory
				crawler, and the rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7416">
				Gurney had time to think:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets! They dare to use
					rockets!</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7417">
				Then he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low,
				crysknife at the ready. Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to
				left and right. Only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were
				visible to Gurney between hood and veil of a sand-colored burnoose, but
				the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting
				man. The eyes were the blue-in-blue of the deep-desert Fremen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7418">
				Gurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the
				other’s knife. If they dared use rockets, they’d have other projectile
				weapons. This moment argued extreme caution. He could tell by sound
				alone that at least part of his skycover had been knocked out. There
				were gruntings, too, the noise of several struggles behind him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7419">
				The eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand
				toward knife, came back to glare into Gurney’s eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7420">
				“Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck,” the man said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7421">
				Gurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a
				stillsuit filter.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7422">“You know my name?” he said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7423">
				“You’ve no need of a knife with me, Gurney,” the man said. He
				straightened, slipped his crysknife into its
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7424"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="668"></span
				>sheath back beneath his robe. “Tell your men to stop their useless
				resistance.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7425">
				The man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7426">
				The shock of what he saw froze Gurney’s muscles. He thought at first he
				was looking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides. Full recognition
				came slowly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7427">
				“Paul,” he whispered. Then louder: “Is it truly Paul?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7428">
				“Don’t you trust your own eyes?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7429">
				“They said you were dead,” Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7430">
				“Tell your men to submit,” Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower
				reaches of the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7431">
				Gurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul. He saw only a few
				knots of struggle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The
				factory crawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it. There were no
				aircraft overhead.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7432">
				“Stop the fighting,” Gurney bellowed. He took a deep breath, cupped his
				hands for a megaphone. “This is Gurney Halleck! Stop the fight!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7433">
				Slowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward
				him, questioning.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7434">
				“These are friends,” Gurney called.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7435">
				“Fine friends!” someone shouted back. “Half our people murdered.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7436">
				“It’s a mistake,” Gurney said. “Don’t add to it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7437">
				He turned back to Paul, stared into the youth’s blue-blue Fremen eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7438">
				A smile touched Paul’s mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression
				that reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul’s grandfather. Gurney saw
				then the sinewy
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7439"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="669"></span
				>harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an
				Atreides&mdash;a leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and
				calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7440">
				“They said you were dead,” Gurney repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7441">
				“And it seemed the best protection to let them think so,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7442">
				Gurney realized that was all the apology he’d ever get for having been
				abandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke…his
				friend, was dead. He wondered then if there were anything left here of
				the boy he had known and trained in the ways of fighting men.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7443">
				Paul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting.
				“Gurney….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7444">
				It seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each
				other on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7445">
				“You young pup! You young pup!” Gurney kept saying.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7446">
				And Paul: “Gurney, man! Gurney, man!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7447">
				Presently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep
				breath. “So you’re why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics.
				I might’ve known. They keep doing things I could’ve planned myself. If
				I’d only known….” He shook his head. “If you’d only got word to me, lad.
				Nothing would’ve stopped me. I’d have come arunning and….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7448">
				A look in Paul’s eyes stopped him…the hard, weighing stare.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7449">
				Gurney sighed. “Sure, and there’d have been those
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7450"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="670"></span
				>who wondered why Gurney Halleck went arunning, and some would’ve done
				more than question. They’d have gone hunting for answers.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7451">
				Paul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them&mdash;the looks
				of curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the
				death commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled
				him with elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the
				course of the future where all was well.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7452">
				<i class="calibre2">With Gurney at my side….</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7453">
				Paul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew
				who had come with Halleck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7454">
				“How do your men stand, Gurney?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7455">
				“They’re smugglers all,” Gurney said. “They stand where the profit is.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7456">
				“Little enough profit in our venture,” Paul said, and he noted the
				subtle finger signal flashed to him by Gurney’s right hand&mdash;the old
				hand code out of their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the
				smuggler crew.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7457">
				Paul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men
				standing guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of
				the unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul’s elation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7458">
				“Stilgar,” he said, “this is Gurney Halleck of whom you’ve heard me
				speak. My father’s master-of-arms, one of the swordmasters who
				instructed me, an old friend. He can be trusted in any venture.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7459">
				“I hear,” Stilgar said. “You are his Duke.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7460">
				Paul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which
				had impelled Stilgar to say just that.
				<i class="calibre2">His Duke.</i> There had been a strange subtle
				intonation in
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7461"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="671"></span
				>Stilgar’s voice, as though he would rather have said something else.
				And that wasn’t like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who
				spoke his mind.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7462">
				<i class="calibre2">My Duke!</i> Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Yes, with Leto dead, the title fell on Paul’s shoulders.</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7463">
				The pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in
				Gurney’s mind. <i class="calibre2">My Duke!</i> A place that had been
				dead within him began coming alive. Only part of his awareness focused
				on Paul’s ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be
				questioned.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7464">
				Gurney’s mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men
				protesting. He shook his head, whirled. “Are you men deaf?” he barked.
				“This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7465">
				Grumbling, the smugglers submitted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7466">
				Paul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. “I’d not have
				expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7467">
				“I’m properly chastened,” Gurney said. “I’ll wager yon patch of spice is
				little more than a sand grain’s thickness, a bait to lure us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7468">
				“That’s a wager you’d win,” Paul said. He looked down at the men being
				disarmed. “Are there any more of my father’s men among your crew?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7469">
				“None. We’re spread thin. There’re a few among the free traders. Most
				have spent their profits to leave this place.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7470">“But you stayed.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7471">“I stayed.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7472">
				“Because Rabban is here,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7473">
				“I thought I had nothing left but revenge,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7474">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-7475"

				>An oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see
				a Fremen waving his kerchief.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7476">
				“A maker comes,” Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney
				following, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could
				be seen in the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly
				through the dunes on a course toward the ridge.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7477">“He’s big enough,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7478">
				A clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned
				on its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7479">
				“Too bad we couldn’t have saved the carryall,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7480">
				Gurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris
				out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down
				by Fremen rockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost
				there&mdash;his men, and he said: “Your father would’ve been more
				concerned for the men he couldn’t save.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7481">
				Paul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said:
				“They were your friends, Gurney. I understand. To us, though, they were
				trespassers who might see things they shouldn’t see. You must understand
				that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7482">
				“I understand it well enough,” Gurney said. “Now, I’m curious to see
				what I shouldn’t.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7483">
				Paul looked up to see the old and well-remembered wolfish grin on
				Halleck’s face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man’s jaw.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7484">
				Gurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about
				their business all over the landscape.
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7485"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="673"></span
				>It struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the
				worm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7486">
				A thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of
				spice&mdash;a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet.
				Gurney saw Fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the
				worm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7487">
				The worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its
				rings rippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above
				the desert, Gurney saw the taking of a worm&mdash;the daring leap of the
				first hookman, the turning of the creature, the way an entire band of
				men went up the scaly, glistening curve of the worm’s side.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7488">
				“There’s one of the things you shouldn’t have seen,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7489">
				“There’s been stories and rumors,” Gurney said. “But it’s not a thing
				easy to believe without seeing it.” He shook his head. “The creature all
				men on Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7490">
				“You heard my father speak of desert power,” Paul said. “There it is.
				The surface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition
				can stop us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7491">
				<i class="calibre2">Us,</i> Gurney thought.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of them.</i
				>
				Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul’s eyes. His own eyes, he
				knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods
				and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among
				them. They spoke of “the touch of the spicebrush” to mean a man had gone
				too native. And there was always a hint of distrust in the idea.

				>“There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in
				these latitudes,” Paul said. “But Rabban has little enough air cover
				left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand.” He
				looked at Gurney. “Your aircraft were a shock to us here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7494">
				<i class="calibre2">To us…to us….</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7495">
				Gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. “We weren’t the shock
				to you that you were to us,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7496">
				“What’s the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7497">
				“They say they’ve fortified the graben villages to the point where you
				cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses
				while you wear yourselves out in futile attack.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7498">
				“In a word,” Paul said, “they’re immobilized.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7500">
				“It’s a tactic I learned from you,” Paul said. “They’ve lost the
				initiative, which means they’ve lost the war.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7501">
				Gurney smiled, a slow, knowing expression.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7502">
				“Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be,” Paul said. He glanced at
				Gurney. “Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this
				campaign?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7503">
				“Enlist?” Gurney stared at him. “My Lord, I’ve never left your service.
				You’re the only one left me…to think you dead. And I, being cast adrift,
				made what shrift I could, waiting for the moment I might sell my life
				for what it’s worth&mdash;the death of Rabban.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7504">
				An embarrassed silence settled over Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7505">
				A woman came climbing up the rocks toward them,

				>her eyes between stillsuit hood and face mask flicking between Paul and
				his companion. She stopped in front of Paul. Gurney noted the possessive
				air about her, the way she stood close to Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7507">
				“Chani,” Paul said, “this is Gurney Halleck. You’ve heard me speak of
				him.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7508">
				She looked at Halleck, back to Paul. “I have heard.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7509">
				“Where did the men go on the maker?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7510">
				“They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7511">
				“Well then….” Paul broke off, sniffed the air.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7512">
				“There’s wind coming,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7513">
				A voice called out from the ridgetop above them: “Ho, there&mdash;the
				wind!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7514">
				Gurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now&mdash;a rushing
				about and sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought
				about by fear of the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry
				beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks…and the
				rocks closed behind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7515">
				“Have you many such hiding places?” Gurney asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7516">
				“Many times many,” Paul said. He looked at Chani. “Find Korba. Tell him
				that Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who’re
				not to be trusted.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7517">
				She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the
				rocks, leaping with a gazelle-like agility.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7518">
				“She is your woman,” Gurney said.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7521">
				Gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7522">
				Paul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color
				dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of
				wind that whipped dust around their heads.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7523">
				“Seal your suit,” Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his
				face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7524">
				Gurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7525">
				Paul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: “Which of your crew don’t
				you trust, Gurney?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7526">
				“There’re some new recruits,” Gurney said. “Offworlders….” He hesitated,
				wondering at himself suddenly. <i class="calibre2">Offworlders.</i> The
				word had come so easily to his tongue.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7527">“Yes?” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7528">
				“They’re not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get,” Gurney said.
				“They’re tougher.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7529">
				“Harkonnen spies?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7530">
				“I think, m’Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. I suspect they’re
				men of the Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about
				them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7531">
				Paul shot a sharp glance at him. “Sardaukar?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7532">
				Gurney shrugged. “They could be, but it’s well masked.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7533">
				Paul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern
				of Atreides retainer…but with subtle reservations…differences. Arrakis
				had changed him, too.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7536">
				“Where are my crew now?” Gurney asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7537">
				“Secure in the rocks below us,” Paul said. “We’ve a cave here&mdash;Cave
				of Birds. We’ll decide what to do with them after the storm.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7538">
				A voice called from above them: “Muad’Dib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7539">
				Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the
				cave. Paul signaled he had heard.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7540">
				Gurney studied him with a new expression. “You’re Muad’Dib?” he asked.
				“You’re the will-o’-the-sand?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7541">
				“It’s my Fremen name,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7542">
				Gurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his
				own crew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the
				new recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men,
				friends, people for whom he felt responsible.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“We’ll decide what to do with them after the storm.”</i
				>
				That’s what Paul had said, Muad’Dib had said. And Gurney recalled the
				stories told of Muad’Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib&mdash;how he had taken the
				skin of a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded
				by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death
				chants on their lips.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7543"><i class="calibre2">Him.</i></p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7544">
				The two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front
				of Paul. The dark-faced one said: “All secure, Muad’Dib. We best get
				below now.”

				>Gurney noted the tone of the man’s voice&mdash;half command and half
				request. This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new
				Fremen legends.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7548">
				Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: “Korba, what’s in
				the bundle?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7549">
				Stilgar answered: “’Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your
				friend here and it contains a baliset. Many times have I heard you speak
				of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7550">
				Gurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the
				stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7551">
				“You’ve a companion who thinks, m’Lord,” Gurney said. “Thank you,
				Stilgar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7552">
				Stilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said:
				“Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7553">
				Gurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this
				conversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney
				wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here was
				someone called Gurney Halleck who’d known Paul even in the times before
				Arrakis, a man who shared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7554">
				“You are two I’d have be friends,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7555">
				“Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown,” Gurney said. “Any killer of
				Harkonnens I’d feel honored to count among my friends.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7556">
				“Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?” Paul
				asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7557">
				Slowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy
				<span

					title="679"></span
				>calluses of Gurney’s swordhand. “There’re few who haven’t heard the
				name of Gurney Halleck,” he said, and released his grip. He turned to
				Paul. “The storm comes rushing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7559">“At once,” Paul said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7560">
				Stilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and
				turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low
				entrance of a cave. Men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them.
				Glowglobes showed a broad, dome-ceilinged space with a raised ledge on
				one side and a passage leading off from it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7561">
				Paul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into
				the passage. The others headed for another passage opposite the
				entrance. Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with
				dark, wine-colored hangings on its walls.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7562">
				“We can have some privacy here for a while,” Paul said. “The others will
				respect my&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7563">
				An alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting
				and clashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and
				out onto the atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right
				behind, weapon drawn.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7564">
				Beneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling
				figures. Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the
				Fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses
				that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a
				significant face&mdash;the Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler
				robes, but the smugglers were crouched in trios, backed into triangles
				where pressed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7565">
				<span

				>That habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7567">
				A Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battle cry was lifted to echo
				in the chamber: “Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7568">
				Another eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward
				him. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him,
				glanced to see Gurney retrieve it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7569">
				The triangular knots were being pressed back now.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7570">
				Gurney held the knife up in front of Paul’s eyes, pointed to the
				hairline yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest,
				multifaceted eyes at the pommel.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7571">Sardaukar for certain.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7572">
				Paul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar
				remained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted
				pattern across the chamber.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7573">
				“Hold!” Paul shouted. “The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7574">
				The fighting wavered, hesitated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7575">
				“You Sardaukar!” Paul called to the remaining group. “By whose orders do
				you threaten a ruling Duke?” And, quickly, as his men started to press
				in around the Sardaukar: “Hold, I say!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7576">
				One of the cornered trio straightened. “Who says we’re Sardaukar?” he
				demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7577">
				Paul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. “This says you’re
				Sardaukar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7578">
				“Then who says you’re a ruling Duke?” the man demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7579">
				Paul gestured to the Fedaykin. “These men say I’m a
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-7580"

				>ruling Duke. Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides.
				<i class="calibre2">I</i> am House Atreides.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7581">
				The Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7582">
				Paul studied the man&mdash;tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across
				half his left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner,
				but still there was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar
				appeared undressed&mdash;and with which he could appear fully clothed
				though naked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7583">
				Paul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: “Korba, how came
				they to have weapons?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7584">
				“They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their
				stillsuits,” the lieutenant said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7585">
				Paul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his
				attention back to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The
				lieutenant lowered his eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7586">
				“Where is Chani?” Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7587">
				“Stilgar spirited her aside.” He nodded toward the other passage,
				glanced at the dead and wounded. “I hold myself responsible for this
				mistake, Muad’Dib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7588">
				“How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7589">“Ten.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7590">
				Paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand
				within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7591">
				A tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed
				to danger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the
				Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad’Dib.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7592">
				<span

					id="calibre_link-7593"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7594">
				“Four wounded, two dead, Muad’Dib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7595">
				Paul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar; Chani and Stilgar were standing in
				the other passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring
				into the offworld whites of the spokesman’s eyes. “You, what is your
				name?” Paul demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7596">
				The man stiffened, glanced left and right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7597">
				“Don’t try it,” Paul said. “It’s obvious to me that you were ordered to
				seek out and destroy Muad’Dib. I’ll warrant you were the ones suggested
				seeking spice in the deep desert.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7598">
				A gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Paul’s lips. Blood
				suffused the Sardaukar’s face.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7599">
				“What you see before you is more than Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “Seven of
				you are dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against
				Sardaukar, eh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7600">
				The man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7601">
				“I asked your name,” Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of
				Voice: “Tell me your name!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7602">
				“Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!” the man snapped. His jaw
				dropped. He stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had
				dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7603">
				“Well, Captain Aramsham,” Paul said, “the Harkonnens would pay dearly to
				learn what you now know. And the Emperor&mdash;what he wouldn’t give to
				learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7604">
				The captain glanced left and right at the two men
				<span

					id="calibre_link-7605"

				>remaining to him. Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in
				the man’s head. Sardaukar did not submit, but the Emperor
				<i class="calibre2">had</i> to learn of this threat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7606">
				Still using the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, Captain.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7607">
				The man at the captain’s left leaped without warning toward Paul, met
				the flashing impact of his own captain’s knife in his chest. The
				attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7608">
				The captain faced his sole remaining companion. “I decide what best
				serves His Majesty,” he said. “Understood?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7609">
				The other Sardaukar’s shoulders slumped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7610">
				“Drop your weapon,” the captain said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7611">The Sardaukar obeyed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7612">
				The captain returned his attention to Paul. “I have killed a friend for
				you,” he said. “Let us always remember that.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7613">
				“You’re my prisoners,” Paul said. “You submitted to me. Whether you live
				or die is of no importance.” He motioned to his guard to take the two
				Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7614">
				The guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7615">
				Paul bent toward his lieutenant.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7616">
				“Muad’Dib,” the man said. “I failed you in….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7617">
				“The failure was mine, Korba,” Paul said. “I should’ve warned you what
				to seek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this.
				Remember, too, that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined
				with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective
				transmitter. They’ll have more than one false tooth. They carry coils of

				<span

				his head in the process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope
				them&mdash;both reflex and hard ray&mdash;cut off every scrap of body
				hair. And when you’re through, be certain you haven’t discovered
				everything.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7619">
				He looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7620">
				“Then we best kill them,” the lieutenant said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7621">
				Paul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. “No. I want them to
				escape.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7622">
				Gurney stared at him. “Sire….” he breathed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7623">“Yes?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7624">
				“Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all

				learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7625">
				“The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me,” Paul said. He
				spoke slowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced
				the Sardaukar. A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness.
				“Gurney,” he said, “are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7626">
				Gurney straightened, eyes narrowed. “Your question makes no….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7627">“Are there?” Paul barked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7628">

				“The people who can destroy a thing, they control it,” Paul said. He
				waved a hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar
				who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7634">
				Paul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar.
				“You live for the good of the tribe,” Paul said. “Could you draw my
				life’s blood with that knife?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7635">
				“For the good of the tribe,” Stilgar growled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7636">
				“Then use that knife,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7637">
				“Are you calling me out?” Stilgar demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7638">
				“If I do,” Paul said, “I shall stand there without weapon and let you
				slay me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7639">
				Stilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7640">
				Chani said, “Usul!” then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7641">
				While Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: “You are Stilgar,
				a fighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in
				the front of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7642">
				“She’s my niece,” Stilgar said. “If there’d been any doubt of your
				Fedaykin handling those scum….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7643">
				“Why was your first thought of Chani?” Paul demanded.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7644">“It wasn’t!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7645">“Oh?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7646">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7649">
				Stilgar began to tremble. “It’s the way,” he muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7650">
				“It’s the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take
				their water as a gift from Shai-hulud,” Paul said. “Yet you permitted
				two such to live one night, my mother and myself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7651">
				As Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: “Ways
				change, Stil. You have changed them yourself.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7652">
				Stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7653">
				“When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think I’ll
				have time to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?”
				Paul asked. “Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every
				family?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7654">
				Stilgar continued staring at the knife.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7655">
				“Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?” Paul demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7656">
				Slowly, Stilgar looked up at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7657">
				“You!” Paul said. “Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of
				your wisdom and strength?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7658">
				In a low voice, Stilgar said: “The young man of my tribe whose name is
				known to me, this young man I could kill on the challenge floor,
				Shai-hulud willing. The Lisan al-Gaib, him I could not harm. You knew
				this when you handed me this knife.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7659">“I knew it,” Paul agreed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7660">
				Stilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7663">
				“But you said we would go to the south!” she protested.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7664">
				“I was wrong,” he said. “The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7665">
				She took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7666">
				“You will give my mother a message for her ears alone,” Paul said. “Tell
				her that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be
				found to make the young men accept this without combat.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7667">Chani glanced at Stilgar.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7668">
				“Do as he says,” Stilgar growled. “We both know he could overcome me…and
				I could not raise my hand against him…for the good of the tribe.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7669">
				“I shall return with your mother,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7670">
				“Send her,” Paul said. “Stilgar’s instinct was right. I am stronger when
				you are safe. You will remain in the sietch.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7671">
				She started to protest, swallowed it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7672">
				“Sihaya,” Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to
				the right, met Gurney’s glaring eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7673">
				The interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though
				in a cloud around Gurney since Paul’s reference to his mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7674">“Your mother,” Gurney said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7675">
				“Idaho saved us the night of the raid,” Paul said, distracted by the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7676">

				Paul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted

				There was murmuring nervousness in the voices. Little cliques gathered
				like knots among the robes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7687">
				Jessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the
				ledge from Paul’s private quarters. She felt rested after the long
				journey up from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet

				Paul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale

				the sounds of shuffling feet.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7690">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7692">
				Stilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the

				stood without talking.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7693">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7694">
				She strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped

				And silence followed her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7695">
				She knew the meaning of the silence&mdash;the unspoken questions of the
				people, awe of the Reverend Mother.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7696">
				The young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7697">Paul looked at her.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7698">
				“It’s time,” she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7699">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7704">“Do it!” someone shrieked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7705">
				Murmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7706">
				Paul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7709">
				<i class="calibre2">Indeed, they are tired of waiting,</i> Paul thought.
				He hefted the message cylinder, thinking of what it contained. His

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7710">
				The message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7711">
				Again, Paul raised his voice: “You think it’s time I called out Stilgar
				and changed the leadership of the troops!” Before they could respond,
				Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: “Do you think the Lisan al-Gaib

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7712">There was stunned silence.</p>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7719">“As you wish,” Paul said.</p>

				“You will say,” he agreed. “But first you will hear my say.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7722">
				Stilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive. “That is the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7723">
				“The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?” Paul

				“All right,” Paul said. “Then, who rules this troop of our

				Paul waited, looking over the heads of the throng. No answer came.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7727">
				Presently, he said: “Does Stilgar rule all this? He says himself that he

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7728">
				There was shuffling silence among the crowd.

				“That’s the way!” someone shouted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7735">
				“What’s our goal?” Paul asked. “To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7736">
				“Hard tasks need hard ways,” someone shouted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7737">
				“Do you smash your knife before a battle?” Paul demanded. “I say this as

				Stilgar’s own admission. He knows it, so do you all.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7738">

				“So,” Paul said, “we come to this.” He lifted the message cylinder,
				removed its scrap of tape. “This was taken from a Harkonnen courier. Its

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7743">Stilgar moved up beside Paul.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7763">
				Stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7764">
				“Hand me your crysknife,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7765">Stilgar obeyed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7766">
				<i class="calibre2">This was not as we planned it</i>, Jessica thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7767">
				“Repeat after me, Stilgar,” Paul said, and he called up the words of
				investiture as he had heard his own father use them. “I, Stilgar, take
				this knife from the hands of my Duke.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7768">
				“I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke,” Stilgar said,
				and accepted the milky blade from Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7769">
				“Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7770">
				Stilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7771">
				Remembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook
				her head. <i class="calibre2">I know the reasons for this,</i> she

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7772">
				“I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his
				enemies for as long as our blood shall flow,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7773">
				Stilgar repeated it after him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7774">
				“Kiss the blade,” Paul ordered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7775">
				Stilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul’s knife arm. At
				a nod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.

				through her son!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7778">
				“Stilgar leads this tribe,” Paul said. “Let no man mistake that. He
				commands with my voice. What he tells you, it is as though I told you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7779">
				<i class="calibre2">Wise</i>, Jessica thought.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7780">
				Paul lowered his voice, said: “Stilgar, I want sandwalkers out this
				night and cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering. When you’ve sent
				them, bring Chatt, Korba and Otheym and two other lieutenants of your
				own choosing. Bring them to my quarters for battle planning. We must
				have a victory to show the Council of Leaders when they arrive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7781">
				Paul nodded for his mother to accompany him, led the way down off the
				ledge and through the throng toward the central passage and the living
				chambers that had been prepared there. As Paul pressed through the
				crowd, hands reached out to touch him. Voices called out to him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7782">
				“My knife goes where Stilgar commands it, Paul-Muad’Dib! Let us fight

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7783">
				Feeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of

				<i class="calibre2">We are taking them at the crest</i>, she thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7784">

				<i class="calibre2">He is going to bring Gurney Halleck here</i>, she
				thought. And she wondered at the strange mingling of emotions that
				filled her. Gurney and his music had been a part of so many pleasant
				times on Caladan before the move to Arrakis. She felt that Caladan had
				happened to some other person. In the nearly three years since then, she
				had <i class="calibre2">become</i> another person. Having to confront
				Gurney forced a reassessment of the changes.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7788">
				Paul’s coffee service, the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he
				had inherited from Jamis, rested on a low table to her right. She stared
				at it, thinking of how many hands had touched that metal. Chani had
				served Paul from it within the month.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7789">

				Jessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of Arrakis for the life of
				power and security she could know as mother of a royal consort. She
				glanced at the thick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7793">
				A sudden longing to see her grandson, the child whose likeness carried
				so much of the grandfather’s features&mdash;so like Leto, swept through
				her. Jessica placed her palms against her cheeks, began the ritual

				mind’s demands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7794">
				Paul’s choice of this Cave of Birds as his command post could not be

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7795">
				A cough sounded outside the chamber hangings. Jessica straightened, took

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7796">“Enter,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7797">
				Draperies were flung aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room. She

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7798">
				“Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?” she demanded.

				“You thought you had escaped, eh, witch?” Gurney snarled.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7802">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7804">
				“You will stand where you are, m’Lord,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7805">“What….” Paul shook his head.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7806">
				Jessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7807">
				“You will speak only when I permit it, witch,” Gurney said. “I want only
				one thing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send
				this knife into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter
				against me. Your voice will remain in a monotone. Certain muscles you

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7808">
				Paul took a step forward. “Gurney, man, what is&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7809">
				“Stop right where you are!” Gurney snapped. “One more step and she’s

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7810">
				Paul’s hand slipped to his knife hilt. He spoke in a deadly quiet: “You
				had best explain yourself, Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7811">
				“I swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father,” Gurney said. “Do

				“You couldn’t be more wrong, Gurney,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7814">
				And Jessica thought: <i class="calibre2">So that’s it! What irony!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7815">
				“Wrong, am I?” Gurney demanded. “Let us hear it from the woman herself.
				And let her remember that I have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm
				this charge. I’ve even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get
				part of the story.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7816">
				Jessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly, but before she could
				speak, Paul said: “The betrayer was Yueh. I tell you this once, Gurney.
				The evidence is complete, cannot be controverted. It was Yueh. I do not
				care how you came by your suspicion&mdash;for it can be nothing
				else&mdash;but if you harm my mother….” Paul lifted his crysknife from
				its scabbard, held the blade in front of him. “…I’ll have your blood.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7817">
				“Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house,” Gurney snarled.
				“He could not turn traitor!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7818">
				“I know a way to remove that conditioning,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7819">“Evidence,” Gurney insisted.</p>

				“This is a trick,” Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica’s
				throat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7822">
				“No trick, Gurney,” Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of
				terrible sadness that the sound tore at Jessica’s heart.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7823">
				“I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent,” Gurney said. “The

				“Ayah!” Gurney said. “You’ve not&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7827">
				“Be quiet,” Paul said, and the monotone stillness of his words carried

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7828">
				<i class="calibre2">He has the Great Control</i>, she thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7829">
				Gurney’s arm trembled against her neck. The point of the knife at her
				back moved with uncertainty.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7830">
				“What you have not done,” Paul said, “is heard my mother sobbing in the
				night over her lost Duke. You have not seen her eyes stab flame when she

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7831">
				<i class="calibre2">So he has listened</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">Tears blinded her eyes.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7832">
				“What you have not done,” Paul went on, “is remembered the lessons you
				learned in a Harkonnen slave pit. You speak of pride in my father’s
				friendship! Didn’t you learn the difference between Harkonnen and
				Atreides so that you could smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they
				left on it? Didn’t you learn that Atreides loyalty is bought with love
				while the Harkonnen coin is hate? Couldn’t you see through to the very
				nature of this betrayal?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7833">“But Yueh?” Gurney muttered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7834">
				“The evidence we have is Yueh’s own message to us admitting his
				treachery,” Paul said. “I swear this to you by the love I hold for you,
				a love I will still hold even after I leave you dead on this floor.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7835">
				Hearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the

				>“My father had an instinct for his friends,” Paul said. “He gave his
				love sparingly, but with never an error. His weakness lay in
				misunderstanding hatred. He thought anyone who hated Harkonnens could
				not betray him.” He glanced at his mother. “She knows this. I’ve given
				her my father’s message that he never distrusted her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7838">
				Jessica felt herself losing control, bit at her lower lip. Seeing the
				stiff formality in Paul, she realized what these words were costing him.
				She wanted to run to him, cradle his head against her breast as she
				never had done. But the arm against her throat had ceased its trembling;
				the knife point at her back pressed still and sharp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7839">
				“One of the most terrible moments in a boy’s life,” Paul said, “is when
				he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love
				that he can never quite taste. It’s a loss, an awakening to the fact
				that the world is <i class="calibre2">there</i> and
				<i class="calibre2">here</i> and we are in it alone. The moment carries
				its own truth; you can’t evade it. I <i class="calibre2">heard</i> my
				father when he spoke of my mother. She’s not the betrayer, Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7840">
				Jessica found her voice, said: “Gurney, release me.” There was no
				special command in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but
				Gurney’s hand fell away. She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not
				touching him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7841">
				“Paul,” she said, “there are other awakenings in this universe. I
				suddenly see how I’ve used you and twisted you and manipulated you to
				set you on a course of my choosing…a course I had to choose&mdash;if

				“Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends,” she

				Paul led his mother to a cushion, seated her there with her back to the

				The figure above was not one of her own escort.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7926">
				“Hurry,” he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7930">
				The Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7945">
				“New victories,” Jessica said. “Rabban has sent cautious overtures about

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7946">

				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7948">
				“The land is beautiful, true,” Chani said. “But there is much grief in

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7949">
				“Grief is the price of victory,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7950">
				<i class="calibre2">Is she preparing me for grief?</i> Chani asked

				“I summoned you,” Jessica said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7952">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7954">
				“I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants,” Jessica said. “It

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7956">
				“You were needed here to help me revive Paul,” Jessica said. And she

				Chani took only a moment to calm herself, then: “What is it I may do?”

				<i class="calibre2">“Take me to him!”</i> But she waited silently for
				the answer.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7958">
				“I suspect,” Jessica said, “that the Harkonnens have managed to send an
				agent among us to poison Paul. It’s the only explanation that seems to
				fit. A most unusual poison. I’ve examined his blood in the most subtle
				ways without detecting it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7959">
				Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees. “Poison? Is he in pain?
				Could I….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7960">
				“He is unconscious,” Jessica said. “The processes of his life are so low
				that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. I

				<i class="calibre2">She is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive,</i>

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7964">
				“Chani,” Jessica said, “you may find this difficult to believe, but I do
				not know precisely why I sent for you. It was an instinct…a basic
				intuition. The thought came unbidden: ‘Send for Chani.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7965">
				For the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica’s expression, the
				unveiled pain modifying the inward stare.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7966">
				“I’ve done all I know to do,” Jessica said. “That
				<i class="calibre2">all</i>…it is so far beyond what is usually supposed
				as <i class="calibre2">all</i> that you would find difficulty imagining
				it. Yet…I failed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7967">
				“The old companion, Halleck,” Chani asked, “is it possible he’s a
				traitor?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7968">“Not Gurney,” Jessica said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7969">
				The two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the
				searching, the tests…the memories of old failures that went into this
				flat denial.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7970">
				Chani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained
				robe. “Take me to him,” she said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7971">
				Jessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7972">
				Chani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock
				walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad
				against the far wall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face.
				A black robe covered him to the chest, leaving his arms outside
				<span

					id="calibre_link-7973"

				>it stretched along his sides. He appeared to be unclothed under the
				robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid. There was no visible
				movement to him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7974">
				Chani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him.
				She found her thoughts, instead, going to her son&mdash;Leto. And she
				realized in this instant that Jessica once had faced such a
				moment&mdash;her man threatened by death, forced in her own mind to
				consider what might be done to save a young son. The realization formed
				a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani reached out and clasped
				Jessica’s hand. The answering grip was painful in its intensity.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7975">
				“He lives,” Jessica said. “I assure you he lives. But the thread of his
				life is so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among
				the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the
				Reverend Mother, that my son is truly dead and I do not want to give up
				his water to the tribe.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7976">
				“How long has he been this way?” Chani asked. She disengaged her hand
				from Jessica’s, moved farther into the room.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7977">
				“Three weeks,” Jessica said. “I spent almost a week trying to revive
				him. There were meetings, arguments…investigations. Then I sent for you.
				The Fedaykin obey my orders, else I might not have been able to delay
				the….” She wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7978">
				Chani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that
				framed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong
				nose, the shuttered eyes&mdash;the features so peaceful in this rigid
				repose.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7981">
				“The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food,”
				Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7982">
				“How many know of what has happened?” Chani asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7983">
				“Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of
				course, whoever administered the poison.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7984">
				“There is no clue to the poisoner?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7985">
				“And it’s not for want of investigating,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7986">
				“What do the Fedaykin say?” Chani asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7987">
				“They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers
				before the final battles. This is a thought I’ve cultivated.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7988">
				Chani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul’s
				face. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face…but
				it was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated
				everything in Fremen life. Still….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7989">
				“You were not born to the spice as we were,” Chani said. “Have you
				investigated the possibility that his body has rebelled against too much
				spice in his diet?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7990">
				“Allergy reactions are all negative,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7991">
				She closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden
				realization of fatigue.
				<i class="calibre2">How long have I been without sleep?</i> she asked

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7992">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7996">
				Presently, Chani said: “Is there a maker here?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7997">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-7998">
				“But Paul-Muad’Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies,” Chani

				“Get me the raw Water of the maker,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8004">
				Jessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani’s voice, then observed
				the intense concentration in the younger woman and said: “At once.” She
				went out through the hangings to send a waterman.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8005">
				Chani sat staring at Paul.
				<i class="calibre2">If he has tried to do this</i>, she thought.
				<i class="calibre2">And it’s the sort of thing he might try</i>….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8006">
				Jessica knelt beside Chani, holding out a plain camp ewer. The charged
				odor of the poison was sharp in Chani’s nostrils. She dipped a finger in
				the fluid, held the finger close to Paul’s nose.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8007">
				The skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly. Slowly, the
				nostrils flared.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8008">Jessica gasped.</p>

				>Chani touched the dampened finger to Paul’s upper lip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8011">
				He drew in a long, sobbing breath.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8012">
				“What is this?” Jessica demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8013">
				“Be still,” Chani said. “You must convert a small amount of the sacred
				water. Quickly!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8014">
				Without questioning, because she recognized the tone of awareness in
				Chani’s voice, Jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small
				sip.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8015">
				Paul’s eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8016">
				“It is not necessary for her to change the Water,” he said. His voice
				was weak, but steady.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8017">
				Jessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying,
				converting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the
				ceremony always imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul&mdash;a
				radiation there registering on her senses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8018">In that instant, she knew.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8019">
				“You drank the sacred water!” she blurted.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8020">
				“One drop of it,” Paul said. “So small…one drop.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8021">
				“How could you do such a foolish thing?” she demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8022">“He is your son,” Chani said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8023">Jessica glared at her.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8024">
				A rare smile, warm and full of understanding, touched Paul’s lips. “Hear
				my beloved,” he said. “Listen to her, Mother. She knows.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8025">
				“A thing that others can do, he must do,” Chani said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8026">
				“When I had the drop in my mouth, when I felt it and smelled it, when I
				knew what it was doing to me, then I knew I could do the thing that you

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8028">
				He tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8029">“Please, my Usul,” she said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8030">
				“I feel so weak,” he said. His gaze darted around the room. “How long
				have I been here?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8031">
				“You’ve been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed
				to have fled,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8032">
				“But it was…. I took it just a moment ago and….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8033">
				“A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me,” Jessica said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8034">
				“It was only one drop, but I converted it,” Paul said. “I changed the
				Water of Life.” And before Chani or Jessica could stop him, he dipped
				his hand into the ewer they had placed on the floor beside him, and he
				brought the dripping hand to his mouth, swallowed the palm-cupped
				liquid.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8035">“Paul!” Jessica screamed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8036">
				He grabbed her hand, faced her with a death’s head grin, and he sent his
				awareness surging over her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8037">
				The rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it
				had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern…but it
				was a rapport: a sense-sharing of the entire being. It shook her,
				weakened her, and she cowered in her mind, fearful of him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8038">
				Aloud, he said: “You speak of a place where you cannot
				<span

				>enter? This place which the Reverend Mother cannot face, show it to

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8040">
				She shook her head, terrified by the very thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8041">
				“Show it to me!” he commanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8042">“No!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8043">
				But she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him,
				she closed her eyes and focused inward&mdash;the-direction-that-is-dark.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8044">
				Paul’s consciousness flowed through and around her and into the
				darkness. She glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself
				away from the terror. Without knowing why, her whole being trembled at
				what she had seen&mdash;a region where a wind blew and sparks glared,
				where rings of light expanded and contracted, where rows of tumescent
				white shapes flowed over and under and around the lights, driven by
				darkness and a wind out of nowhere.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8045">
				Presently, she opened her eyes, saw Paul staring up at her. He still
				held her hand, but the terrible rapport was gone. She quieted her
				trembling. Paul released her hand. It was as though some crutch had been
				removed. She staggered up and back, would have fallen had not Chani
				jumped to support her.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8046">
				“Reverend Mother!” Chani said. “What is wrong?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8047">
				“Tired,” Jessica whispered. “So…tired.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8048">
				“Here,” Chani said. “Sit here.” She helped Jessica to a cushion against
				the wall.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8049">
				The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8050">
				“He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?” Chani asked. She disengaged
				herself from Jessica’s grip.

					>“What was that? What happened? Where was that place?”</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8053">
				Through it all threaded the realization that her son was the Kwisatz

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8054">
				“What happened?” Chani demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8055">Jessica shook her head.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8056">
				Paul said: “There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an
				ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that
				place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost
				impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into
				something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8057">
				Jessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to
				Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8058">
				“Do you understand me, Mother?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8059">She could only nod.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8060">
				“These things are so ancient within us,” Paul said, “that they’re ground
				into each separate cell of our bodies. We’re shaped by such forces. You
				can say to yourself, ‘Yes, I see how such a thing may be.’ But when you
				look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you
				see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest
				peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the
				Taker is the force that gives. It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving
				as by taking.”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8063">
				“I’m at the fulcrum,” he said. “I cannot give without taking and I
				cannot take without….” He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8064">
				Chani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8065">
				“It was Otheym,” Paul said. “He was listening.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8066">
				Accepting the words, Chani was touched by some of the prescience that
				haunted Paul, and she knew a thing-yet-to-be as though it already had
				occurred. Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard. Others would
				spread the story until it was a fire over the land. Paul-Muad’Dib is not
				as other men, they would say. There can be no more doubt. He is a man,
				yet he sees through to the Water of Life in the way of a Reverend
				Mother. He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8067">
				“You have seen the future, Paul,” Jessica said. “Will you say what
				you’ve seen?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8068">
				“Not the future,” he said. “I’ve seen the Now.” He forced himself to a
				sitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. “The Space
				above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8069">
				Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8070">
				“The Padishah Emperor himself is there,” Paul said. He looked at the
				rock ceiling of his cell. “With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions

				muster. Every Great House has its raiders above us…waiting.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8073">
				Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: “For what are they
				waiting?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8074">
				Paul looked at her. “For the Guild’s permission to land. The Guild will
				strand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8075">
				“The Guild’s protecting us?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8076">
				“Protecting us! The Guild itself caused this by spreading tales about

				even the poorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8077">
				Jessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone, wondered at it. She
				couldn’t doubt his words&mdash;they had that same intensity she’d seen
				in him the night he’d revealed the path of the future that’d taken them
				among the Fremen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8078">
				Paul took a deep breath, said: “Mother, you must change a quantity of
				the Water for us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout force sent
				out…to find a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of
				Life above a pre-spice mass, do you know what will happen?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8079">
				Jessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. “Paul!”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8080">
				“The Water of Death,” he said. “It’d be a chain reaction.” He pointed to

				“What stays the Guild’s hand?” Jessica whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8085">
				“They’re searching for me,” Paul said. “Think of that! The finest Guild
				navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest

				find me. How they tremble! They know I have their secret here!” Paul
				held out his cupped hand. “Without the spice they’re blind!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8086">
				Chani found her voice. “You said you see the

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8087">
				Paul lay back, searching the spread-out <i class="calibre2">present</i>,

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8088">
				“Go do as I commanded,” he said. “The future’s becoming as muddled for

				Paul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye
				fixed to the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused
				on a starship lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall
				eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the
				shadow side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night.
				Beyond the ship, the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light
				of the northern sun.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8095">
				It wasn’t the lighter that excited Stilgar’s awe, Paul knew, but the
				construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single
				metal hutment, many stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle
				from the base of the lighter&mdash;a tent composed of interlocking metal
				leaves&mdash;the temporary lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8100">
				“I’m perfectly safe here,” Paul said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8101">
				“That ship mounts projectile weapons,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8102">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8103">
				Paul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the
				pockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his
				father’s troopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things
				that the shades of those men should look down on this moment. The
				Harkonnen forts and towns across the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands
				or cut away from their source like stalks severed from a plant and left
				to wither. Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8104">
				“They might try a sortie by ’thopter,” Stilgar said. “If they see us.”

				He swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field
				now, to the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company

				thought of the desperation that had forced the Guild to permit these two

				<span

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8108">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8109">

				But he took one final look around through the telescope&mdash;studying
				the plain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8114">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8120">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8121">
				“They’re saving their birds for the battle,” Stilgar said. He glanced at
				the communications equipment, back to Paul. “Even with a tight beam, it

				bearing on its emission.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8122">
				“They’ll soon be too busy to find me,” Paul said. “What did the men

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8123">
				“Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8124">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8130">
				“A great grandmother of a storm coming,” Stilgar said. “Can you not feel

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8131">
				“The air does feel chancy,” Paul agreed. “But I like the certainty of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8132">
				“The storm’ll be here in the hour,” Stilgar said. He nodded toward the
				gap that looked out on the Emperor’s hutment and the Harkonnen frigates.
				“They know it there, too. Not a ’thopter in the sky. Everything pulled
				in and tied down. They’ve had a report on the weather from their friends

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8133">
				“Any more probing sorties?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8134">
				“Nothing since the landing last night,” Stilgar said. “They know we’re

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8135">
				“We choose the time,” Paul said.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8136">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8137">
				“That fleet’ll stay in space,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8138">Gurney shook his head.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8139">
				“They have no choice,” Paul said. “We can destroy the spice. The Guild

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8140">
				“Desperate people are the most dangerous,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8141">
				“Are we not desperate?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8142">Gurney scowled at him.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8143">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8147">
				“He’s always gloomy before a battle,” Paul said. “It’s the only form of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8148">
				A slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney’s face, the teeth showing
				white above the chip cut of his stillsuit. “It glooms me much to think
				on all the poor Harkonnen souls we’ll dispatch unshriven,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8149">
				Stilgar chuckled. “He talks like a Fedaykin.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8150">
				“Gurney was born a death commando,” Paul said. And he thought:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Yes, let them occupy their minds with small talk before we test
					ourselves against that force on the plain</i

				the troubadour-warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8151">
				“Worry saps the strength,” Paul murmured. “You told me that once,
				Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8152">
				“My Duke,” Gurney said, “my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them
				to blast a hole in the Shield Wall….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8153">
				“Those people up there won’t use atomics against us,” Paul said. “They

			</p>

				“But the injunction against&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8155">
				“The injunction!” Paul barked. “It’s fear, not the injunction that keeps
				the Houses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the
				Great Convention is clear enough: ‘Use of atomics against humans shall
				be cause for planetary obliteration.’ We’re going to blast the Shield
				Wall, not humans.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8156">
				“It’s too fine a point,” Gurney said.

				He turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he
				said: “What about the city people? Are they in position yet?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8160">“Yes,” Stilgar muttered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8161">
				Paul looked at him. “What’s eating you?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8162">
				“I never knew the city man could be trusted completely,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8163">
				“I was a city man myself once,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8164">
				Stilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. “Muad’Dib knows I did

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8165">
				“I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn’t what you think
				he’ll do. It’s what he actually does. These city people have Fremen
				blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their
				bondage. We’ll teach them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8166">
				Stilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: “The habits of a lifetime,
				Muad’Dib. On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the
				communities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8167">
				Paul glanced at Gurney, saw him studying Stilgar. “Tell us, Gurney, why
				were the cityfolk down there driven from their homes by the Sardaukar?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8168">
				“An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8169">
				“It’s been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have
				forgotten how to fight them,” Paul said. “The Sardaukar have played into

				battle standards with the heads of the men who
				<span

				>objected. And they’ve built up a fever of hate among people who
				otherwise would’ve looked on the coming battle as no more than a great
				inconvenience…and the possibility of exchanging one set of masters for
				another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8171">
				“The city people do seem eager,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8172">
				“Their hate is fresh and clear,” Paul said. “That’s why we use them as
				shock troops.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8173">
				“The slaughter among them will be fearful,” Gurney said. Stilgar nodded
				agreement.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8174">
				“They were told the odds,” Paul said. “They know every Sardaukar they
				kill will be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to
				die for. They’ve discovered they’re a people. They’re awakening.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8175">
				A muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul
				moved to the rock slit, asked: “What is it out there?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8176">
				“A great commotion, Muad’Dib,” the watcher hissed. “At that monstrous
				metal tent. A surface car came from Rimwall West and it was like a hawk
				into a nest of rock partridge.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8177">
				“Our captive Sardaukar have arrived,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8178">
				“They’ve a shield around the entire landing field now,” the watcher
				said. “I can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard
				where they kept the spice.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8179">
				“Now they know who it is they fight,” Gurney said. “Let the Harkonnen
				beasts tremble and fret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8180">
				Paul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. “Watch

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8182">
				“It will not be,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8183">
				Paul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar’s face, said: “If the Emperor
				recognized my claim, he’ll signal by restoring the Atreides flag to
				Arrakis. We’ll use the second plan then, move only against the
				Harkonnens. The Sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue
				between ourselves.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8184">
				“I’ve no experience with these offworld things,” Stilgar said. “I’ve

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8185">
				“You don’t need experience to know what they’ll do,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8186">
				“They’re sending a new flag up on the tall ship,” the watcher said. “The
				flag is yellow…with a black and red circle in the center.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8187">
				“There’s a subtle piece of business,” Paul said. “The CHOAM Company
				flag.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8188">
				“It’s the same as the flag at the other ships,” the Fedaykin guard said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8189">
				“I don’t understand,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8190">
				“A subtle piece of business indeed,” Gurney said. “Had he sent up the
				Atreides banner, he’d have had to live by what that meant. Too many
				observers about. He could’ve signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his
				staff&mdash;a flat declaration that’d have been. But, no&mdash;he sends
				up the CHOAM rag. He’s telling the people up there….” Gurney pointed
				toward space. “…where the profit is. He’s saying he doesn’t care if it’s
				an Atreides here or not.”

				>“How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8193">
				Stilgar turned away, consulted one of the Fedaykin in the bowl.
				Presently, he returned, said: “Very soon, Muad’Dib. Sooner than we
				expected. It’s a great-great grandmother of a storm…perhaps even more
				than you wished.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8194">
				“It’s my storm,” Paul said, and saw the silent awe on the faces of the
				Fedaykin who heard him. “Though it shook the entire world it could not
				be more than I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8195">
				“Close enough to make no difference,” Stilgar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8196">
				A courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin, said: “The
				Sardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back, Muad’Dib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8197">
				“They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good
				visibility,” Stilgar said. “They think we’ll be in the same fix.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8198">
				“Tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops,”
				Paul said. “They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as
				soon as the storm has destroyed the shields.” He stepped to the wall of
				the bowl, pulled back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at
				the sky. The horsetail twistings of blow sand could be seen against the
				dark of the sky. Paul restored the cover, said: “Start sending our men
				down, Stil.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8199">
				“Will you not go with us?” Stilgar asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8200">
				“I’ll wait here a bit with the Fedaykin,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8201">
				Stilgar gave a knowing shrug toward Gurney, moved to the hole in the
				rock wall, was lost in its shadows.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8202">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8204">“I’ll do it.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8205">
				Paul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: “Otheym, start moving the
				check patrols out of the blast area. They must be out of there before
				the storm strikes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8206">
				The man bowed, followed Stilgar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8207">
				Gurney leaned in to the rock slit, spoke to the man at the telescope:
				“Keep your attention on the south wall. It’ll be completely undefended
				until we blow it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8208">
				“Dispatch a cielago with a time signal,” Paul ordered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8209">
				“Some ground cars are moving toward the south wall,” the man at the
				telescope said. “Some are using projectile weapons, testing. Our people
				are using body shields as you commanded. The ground cars have stopped.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8210">
				In the abrupt silence, Paul heard the wind devils playing
				overhead&mdash;the front of the storm. Sand began to drift down into
				their bowl through gaps in the cover. A burst of wind caught the cover,
				whipped it away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8211">
				Paul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter, crossed to the men at the
				communications equipment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney stayed beside
				him. Paul crouched over the signalmen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8212">
				One said: “A great-great-<i class="calibre2">great</i> grandmother of a

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8213">
				Paul glanced up at the darkening sky, said: “Gurney, have the south wall

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8214">Gurney turned to obey.</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8217">Gurney returned.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8218">
				Paul touched his shoulder, pointed to the blast trigger set into the
				tunnel mouth beyond the signalmen. Gurney went into the tunnel, stopped
				there, one hand at the trigger, his gaze on Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8219">
				“We are getting no messages,” the signalman beside Paul said. “Much
				static.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8220">
				Paul nodded, kept his eye on the time-standard dial in front of the
				signalman. Presently, Paul looked at Gurney, raised a hand, returned his
				attention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its final
				circuit.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8221">
				“Now!” Paul shouted, and dropped his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8222">
				Gurney depressed the blast trigger.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8223">
				It seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath
				them ripple and shake. A rumbling sound was added to the storm’s roar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8224">
				The Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul, the
				telescope clutched under one arm. “The Shield Wall is breached,
				Muad’Dib!” he shouted. “The storm is on them and our gunners already are
				firing.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8225">
				Paul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin, the static charge
				within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy
				camp.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8226">
				“The storm!” someone shouted. “We must get under cover, Muad’Dib!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8227">
				Paul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed
				cheeks. <i class="calibre2">We are committed,</i> he thought. He put an

				>“Leave the equipment! There’s more in the tunnel.” He felt himself
				being pulled away, Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him. They
				squeezed into the tunnel mouth, feeling its comparative silence, turned
				a corner into a small chamber with glowglobes overhead and another
				tunnel opening beyond.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8229">
				Another signalman sat there at his equipment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8230">“Much static,” the man said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8231">
				A swirl of sand filled the air around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8232">
				“Seal off this tunnel!” Paul shouted. A sudden pressure of stillness
				showed that his command had been obeyed. “Is the way down to the basin
				still open?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8233">
				A Fedaykin went to look, returned, said: “The explosion caused a little
				rock to fall, but the engineers say it is still open. They’re cleaning
				up with lasbeams.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8234">
				“Tell them to use their hands!” Paul barked. “There are shields active
				down there!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8235">
				“They are being careful, Muad’Dib,” the man said, but he turned to obey.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8236">
				The signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8237">
				“I told those men to leave their equipment!” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8238">
				“Fremen do not like to abandon equipment, Muad’Dib,” one of his Fedaykin
				chided.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8239">
				“Men are more important than equipment now,” Paul said. “We’ll have more
				equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8240">
				Gurney Halleck came up beside him, said: “I heard them say the way down

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8242">
				“They’re in no position to retaliate,” Paul said. “They’re just now
				finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off
				Arrakis.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8243">
				“The new command post is all prepared, though, m’Lord,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8244">
				“They’ve no need of me in the command post yet,” Paul said. “The plan

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8245">
				“I’m getting a message, Muad’Dib,” said the signalman at the
				communications equipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver
				phone against his ear. “Much static!” He began scribbling on a pad in
				front of him, shaking his head waiting, writing…waiting.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8246">
				Paul crossed to the signalman’s side. The Fedaykin stepped back, giving
				him room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8247">
				“Raid…on Sietch Tabr…captives…Alia (blank) families of (blank) dead
				are…they (blank) son of Muad’Dib….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8248">
				Again, the signalman shook his head.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8249">
				Paul looked up to see Gurney staring at him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8250">
				“The message is garbled,” Gurney said. “The static. You don’t know
				that….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8251">
				“My son is dead,” Paul said, and knew as he spoke that it was true. “My
				son is dead…and Alia is a captive…hostage.” He felt emptied, a shell

				eyes downcast in the Imperial audience chamber, the oval selamlik within
				the Padishah Emperor’s hutment. With covert glances, the Baron had
				studied the metal-walled room and its occupants&mdash;the noukkers, the
				pages, the guards, the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up around the
				walls, standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered captured
				battle flags that were the room’s only decoration.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8260">
				Voices sounded from the right of the chamber, echoing out of a high
				passage: “Make way! Make way for the Royal Person!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8261">
				The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the
				audience chamber followed by his suite. He stood waiting while his
				throne was brought, ignoring the Baron, seemingly ignoring every person
				in the room.

				>The Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal Person, and studied
				the Emperor for a sign, any clue to the purpose of this audience. The
				Emperor stood poised, waiting&mdash;a slim, elegant figure in a gray
				Sardaukar uniform with silver and gold trim. His thin face and cold eyes
				reminded the Baron of the Duke Leto long dead. There was that same look
				of the predatory bird. But the Emperor’s hair was red, not black, and
				most of that hair was concealed by a Burseg’s ebon helmet with the
				Imperial crest in gold upon its crown.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8264">
				Pages brought the throne. It was a massive chair carved from a single
				piece of Hagal quartz&mdash;blue-green translucency shot through with
				streaks of yellow fire. They placed it on the dais and the Emperor
				mounted, seated himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8265">
				An old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead
				detached herself from the Emperor’s suite, took up station behind the
				throne, one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out
				of the hood like a witch caricature&mdash;sunken cheeks and eyes, an
				overlong nose, skin mottled and with protruding veins.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8266">
				The Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the
				Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Emperor’s Truthsayer, betrayed
				the importance of this audience. The Baron looked away from her, studied
				the suite for a clue. There were two of the Guild agents, one tall and
				fat, one short and fat, both with bland gray eyes. And among the lackeys
				stood one of the Emperor’s daughters, the Princess Irulan, a woman they
				said was being trained in the deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8267"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="743"></span
				>destined to be a Reverend Mother. She was tall, blonde, face of
				chiseled beauty, green eyes that looked past and through him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8268">“My dear Baron.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8269">
				The Emperor had deigned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with
				exquisite control. It managed to dismiss him while greeting him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8270">
				The Baron bowed low, advanced to the required position ten paces from
				the dais. “I came at your summons, Majesty.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8271">
				“Summons!” the old witch cackled.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8272">
				“Now, Reverend Mother,” the Emperor chided, but he smiled at the Baron’s
				discomfiture, said: “First, you will tell me where you’ve sent your
				minion, Thufir Hawat.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8273">
				The Baron darted his gaze left and right, reviled himself for coming
				here without his own guards, not that they’d be much use against
				Sardaukar. Still….
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8274">“Well?” the Emperor said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8275">
				“He has been gone these five days, Majesty.” The Baron shot a glance at
				the Guild agents, back to the Emperor. “He was to land at a smuggler
				base and attempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic, this
				Muad’Dib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8276">
				“Incredible!” the Emperor said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8277">
				One of the witch’s clawlike hands tapped the Emperor’s shoulder. She
				leaned forward, whispered in his ear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8278">
				The Emperor nodded, said: “Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren’t you
				worried about his absence?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8279">
				“But I <i class="calibre2">am</i> worried, Majesty!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8280">
				The Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother
				emitted a cackling laugh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8281">
				“What I mean, Majesty,” the Baron said, “is that
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8282"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="744"></span
				>Hawat will be dead within another few hours, anyway.” And he explained
				about the latent poison and need for an antidote.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8283">
				“How clever of you, Baron,” the Emperor said. “And where are your
				nephews, Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8284">
				“The storm comes, Majesty. I sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the
				Fremen attack under cover of the sand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8285">
				“Perimeter,” the Emperor said. The word came out as though it puckered
				his mouth. “The storm won’t be much here in the basin, and that Fremen
				rabble won’t attack while I’m here with five legions of Sardaukar.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8286">
				“Surely not, Majesty,” the Baron said. “But error on the side of caution
				cannot be censured.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8287">
				“Ah-h-h-h,” the Emperor said. “Censure. Then I’m not to speak of how
				much time this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me? Nor the CHOAM Company
				profits pouring down this rat hole? Nor the court functions and affairs
				of state I’ve had to delay&mdash;even cancel&mdash;because of this
				stupid affair?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8288">
				The Baron lowered his gaze, frightened by the Imperial anger. The
				delicacy of his position here, alone and dependent upon the Convention
				and the dictum familia of the Great Houses, fretted him.
				<i class="calibre2">Does he mean to kill me?</i> the Baron asked
				himself.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>He couldn’t! Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there, aching
					for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8289">
				“Have you taken hostages?” the Emperor asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8290">
				“It’s useless, Majesty,” the Baron said. “These mad
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8291"

					title="745"></span
				>Fremen hold a burial ceremony for every captive and act as though such
				a one were already dead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8292">“So?” the Emperor said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8293">
				And the Baron waited, glancing left and right at the metal walls of the
				selamlik, thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him. Such
				unlimited wealth it represented that even the Baron was awed.
				<i class="calibre2">He brings pages</i>, the Baron thought,
				<i class="calibre2"
					>and useless court lackeys, his women and their
					companions&mdash;hair-dressers, designers, everything…all the fringe
					parasites of the Court. All here&mdash;fawning, slyly plotting,
					“roughing it” with the Emperor…here to watch him put an end to this
					affair, to make epigrams over the battles and idolize the wounded</i
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8294">
				“Perhaps you’ve never sought the right kind of hostages,” the Emperor
				said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8295">
				<i class="calibre2">He knows something,</i> the Baron thought. Fear sat
				like a stone in his stomach until he could hardly bear the thought of
				eating. Yet, the feeling was like hunger, and he poised himself several
				times in his suspensors on the point of ordering food brought to him.
				But there was no one here to obey his summons.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8296">
				“Do you have any idea who this Muad’Dib could be?” the Emperor asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8297">
				“One of the Umma, surely,” the Baron said. “A Fremen fanatic, a
				religious adventurer. They crop up regularly on the fringes of
				civilization. Your Majesty knows this.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8298">
				The Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the
				Baron. “And you have no other knowledge of this Muad’Dib?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8299">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8300"

				>“A madman,” the Baron said. “But all Fremen are a little mad.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8301">“Mad?”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8302">
				“His people scream his name as they leap into battle. The women throw
				their babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge
				for their men to attack us. They have no…no…decency!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8303">
				“As bad as that,” the Emperor murmured, and his tone of derision did not
				escape the Baron. “Tell me, my dear Baron, have you investigated the
				southern polar regions of Arrakis?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8304">
				The Baron stared up at the Emperor, shocked by the change of subject.
				“But…well, you know, Your Majesty, the entire region is uninhabitable,
				open to wind and worm. There’s not even any spice in those latitudes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8305">
				“You’ve had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery
				appear there?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8306">
				“There’ve always been such reports. Some were investigated&mdash;long
				ago. A few plants were seen. Many ’thopters were lost. Much too costly,
				Your Majesty. It’s a place where men cannot survive for long.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8307">
				“So,” the Emperor said. He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his
				left behind the throne. Through the door came two Sardaukar herding a
				girl-child who appeared to be about four years old. She wore a black
				aba, the hood thrown back to reveal the attachments of a stillsuit
				hanging free at her throat. Her eyes were Fremen blue, staring out of a
				soft, round face. She appeared completely unafraid and there was a look
				to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for no reason he could
				explain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8308">
				<span

				by the child’s presence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8310">
				The Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke
				first&mdash;a thin voice with traces of a soft-palate lisp, but clear
				nonetheless. “So here he is,” she said. She advanced to the edge of the
				dais. “He doesn’t appear much, does he&mdash;one frightened old fat man
				too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8311">
				It was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child
				that the Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger.
				<i class="calibre2">Is it a midget?</i> he asked himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8312">
				“My dear Baron,” the Emperor said, “become acquainted with the sister of
				Muad’Dib.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8313">
				“The sist….” The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. “I do not
				understand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8314">
				“I, too, sometimes err on the side of caution,” the Emperor said. “It
				has been reported to me that your
				<i class="calibre2">uninhabited</i> south polar regions exhibit evidence
				of human activity.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8315">
				“But that’s impossible!” the Baron protested. “The worms…there’s sand
				clear to the….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8316">
				“These people seem able to avoid the worms,” the Emperor said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8317">
				The child sat down on the dais beside the throne, dangled her feet over
				the edge, kicking them. There was such an air of sureness in the way she
				appraised her surroundings.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8318">
				The Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe,
				the wink of sandals beneath the fabric.

				>“Unfortunately,” the Emperor said, “I only sent in five troop carriers
				with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We
				barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron,
				my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of
				women, children, and old men. This child here was in command of one of
				the attacking groups.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8321">
				“You see, Your Majesty!” the Baron said. “You see how they are!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8322">
				“I allowed myself to be captured,” the child said. “I did not want to
				face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8323">
				“Only a handful of our men got away,” the Emperor said. “Got away! You
				hear that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8324">
				“We’d have had them, too,” the child said, “except for the flames.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8325">
				“My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as
				flame-throwers,” the Emperor said. “A move of desperation and the only
				thing that got them away with their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear
				Baron: Sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children
				and old men!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8326">
				“We must attack in force,” the Baron rasped. “We must destroy every last

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8327">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8331">
				The Baron took two backward steps, thinking:
				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8332">
				“And this fake dispute with Duke Leto,” the Emperor purred, sinking back
				into his throne. “How beautifully you maneuvered it.”

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8333">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8334">“Silence!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8335">
				The old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor’s shoulder, leaned close

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8336">
				The child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: “Make him

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8337">
				“Quiet, child,” the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her

				daughter of your ally, Duke Leto?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8338">
				“My father was never his ally,” the child said. “My father is dead and

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8339">
				The Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8340">
				“I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8343">
				“I do not take the Emperor’s orders,” Alia said. She turned, looked up

				The Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. “What does she mean?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8345">
				“That child is an abomination!” the old woman said. “Her mother deserves

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8347">
				“You don’t understand, Majesty,” the old woman said. “Not telepathy.

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8348">
				“What others?” the Emperor demanded. “What’s this nonsense?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8349">
				The old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. “I’ve said too

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8378">
				“I’m sorry, Grandfather,” Alia said. “You’ve met the Atreides gom
				jabbar.” She got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8379">
				The Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his
				left palm. “You…you….” He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging
				mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth
				hanging open.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8380">
				“These people are insane,” the Emperor snarled. “Quick! Into the ship.
				We’ll purge this planet of every….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8381">
				Something sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away
				from the wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell
				of burned insulation swept through the selamlik.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8382">
				“The shield!” one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. “The outer shield
				is down! They….”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8383">
				His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the
				Emperor trembled and rocked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8384">
				“They’ve shot the nose off our ship!” someone called.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8385">
				Dust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran
				toward the outer door.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8386">
				The Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that
				swung open in the ship’s side behind the throne. He flashed a hand
				signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. “We will
				make our stand here!” the Emperor ordered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8387">
				Another crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far
				side of the chamber admitting
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8388"

					title="754"></span
				>windblown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure
				could be seen momentarily against the light&mdash;Alia darting out to
				find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and
				Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze
				toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the
				Emperor’s retreat.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8389">
				“Save yourself, Sire!” a Sardaukar officer shouted. “Into the ship!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8390">
				But the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A
				forty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the
				selamlik’s doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low
				over the outside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning
				crackled from the cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted
				out by the storm’s charge could be seen through the haze. The plain
				surged with figures in combat&mdash;Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed
				men who seemed to come down out of the storm.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8391">
				All this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor’s pointing hand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8392">
				Out of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes&mdash;great
				rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths
				of sandworms, a massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding
				to the attack. They came in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind
				as they cut through the melee on the plain.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8393">
				Onward toward the Emperor’s hutment they came while the House Sardaukar
				stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their
				minds found difficult to accept.

				flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had
				been trained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man
				to man on the plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard
				pressed the Emperor back into the ship, sealed the door on him, and
				prepared to die at the door as part of his shield.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8396">
				In the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared
				at the wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the
				flush of exertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a
				black shadow with her hood pulled about her face, finding at last the
				faces he sought&mdash;the two Guildsmen. They wore the Guild gray,
				unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the
				high emotions around them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8397">
				The taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the
				Emperor watched, someone jostled the Guildsman’s arm, the hand moved,
				and the eye was revealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact
				lenses, and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost
				black.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8398">
				The smaller of the pair elbowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said:
				“We cannot know how it will go.” And the taller companion, hand restored
				to eye, added in a cold voice: “But this Muad’Dib cannot know, either.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8399">
				The words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on
				his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild
				navigator’s single-minded focus on the main chance to see the immediate
				future

				“Reverend Mother,” he said, “we must devise a plan.”

				“Summon Count Fenring from his quarters,” the Reverend Mother said.

				main hall had been overturned or smashed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8410">
				Paul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a

				the place and
				<span

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8412">
				“I remember the day we first came here with your father,” Gurney said.
				He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. “I didn’t
				like this place then and I like it less now. One of our caves would be
				safer.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8413">
				“Spoken like a true Fremen,” Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile
				that his words brought to Muad’Dib’s lips. “Will you reconsider,
				Muad’Dib?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8414">
				“This place is a symbol,” Paul said. “Rabban lived here. By occupying
				this place I seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the
				building. Touch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys
				remain.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8415">
				“As you command,” Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as
				he turned to obey.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8416">
				Communications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began
				setting up near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented
				the surviving Fedaykin took up stations around the room. There was
				muttering among them, much darting of suspicious glances. This had been
				too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it
				casually.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8417">
				“Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani,” Paul said. “Does
				Chani know yet about our son?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8418">
				“The message was sent, m’Lord.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8419">
				“Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8420">
				“Yes, m’Lord. The storm’s almost spent.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8421">
				“What’s the extent of the storm damage?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8422">
				“In the direct path&mdash;on the landing field and across the
				<span

				“As much from battle as from the storm.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8424">
				“Nothing money won’t repair, I presume,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8425">
				“Except for the lives, m’Lord,” Gurney said, and there was a tone of
				reproach in his voice as though to say:
				<i class="calibre2"
					>“When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at
					stake?”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8426">
				But Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps
				visible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through
				each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8427">
				He sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair
				had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own
				father. At the moment, though, it was only an object to rest his
				weariness and conceal it from the men. He sat down, pulling his robes
				around his legs, loosening his stillsuit at the neck.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8428">
				“The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8429">
				“For now, contain him there,” Paul said. “Have they found the Harkonnens
				yet?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8430">
				“They’re still examining the dead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8431">
				“What reply from the ships up there?” He jerked his chin toward the
				ceiling.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8432">“No reply yet, m’Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8433">
				Paul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said:
				“Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We must send a message to our Emperor.
				It’s time to discuss terms.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8434">“Yes, m’Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8435">
				Gurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8436"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="760"></span
				>the Fedaykin who took up close-guard position beside Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8437">
				“Gurney,” Paul whispered. “Since we’ve been rejoined I’ve yet to hear
				you produce the proper quotation for the event.” He turned, saw Gurney
				swallow, saw the sudden grim hardening of the man’s jaw.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8438">
				“As you wish, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: “‘And
				the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for
				the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.’”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8439">
				Paul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as
				he had once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over
				to this day’s accumulated discoveries&mdash;the mixed futures and the
				hidden <i class="calibre2">presence</i> of Alia within his awareness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8440">
				Of all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. “I have breasted
				the future to place my words where only you can hear them,” Alia had
				said. “Even you cannot do that, my brother. I find it an interesting
				play. And…oh, yes&mdash;I’ve killed our grandfather, the demented old
				Baron. He had very little pain.”

				Silence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8442">“Muad’Dib.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8443">
				Paul opened his eyes to see Stilgar’s black-bearded visage above him,
				the dark eyes glaring with battle light.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8444">
				“You’ve found the body of the old Baron,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8445">
				A hush of the person settled over Stilgar. “How could you know?” he
				whispered. “We just found the body in that great pile of metal the
				Emperor built.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8446">
				Paul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8447"

					title="761"></span
				>by two Fremen who supported a captive Sardaukar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8448">
				“Here’s one of them, m’Lord,” Gurney said. He signed to the guard to
				hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8449">
				The Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock.
				A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his
				mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed
				synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on
				his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the
				tattered braid of his trousers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8450">
				“I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8451">
				Paul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that,
				man?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8452">
				The Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8453">
				“Speak up,” Paul said, “or your Emperor may die.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8454">The man blinked, swallowed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8455">“Who am I?” Paul demanded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8456">
				“You are the Duke Paul Atreides,” the man husked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8457">
				He seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been
				prepared for such happenings as this day. They’d never known anything
				but victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness in itself. He put
				that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8458">
				“I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor,” Paul said. And he
				couched his words in the ancient formula: “I, a Duke of a Great House,
				an Imperial Kinsman,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8459"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="762"></span
				>give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and his
				people lay down their arms and come to me here I will guard their lives
				with my own.” Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the
				Sardaukar to see. “I swear it by this.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8460">
				The man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8461">
				“Yes,” Paul said. “Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of
				Gurney Halleck.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8462">
				“I will carry the message,” the Sardaukar said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8463">
				“Take him to our forward command post and send him in,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8464">
				“Yes, m’Lord.” Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8465">Paul turned back to Stilgar.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8466">
				“Chani and your mother have arrived,” Stilgar said. “Chani has asked
				time to be alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in
				the weirding room; I know not why.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8467">
				“My mother’s sick with longing for a planet she may never see,” Paul
				said. “Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you
				cannot walk between them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8468">
				“Water from the sky,” Stilgar whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8469">
				In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the
				Fremen naib to a <i class="calibre2">creature</i> of the Lisan al-Gaib,
				a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and
				Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8470">
				<i class="calibre2">I have seen a friend become a worshiper,</i> he
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8471">
				In a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8472"

					title="763"></span
				>noting how proper and on-review his guards had become in his presence.
				He sensed the subtle, prideful competition among them&mdash;each hoping
				for notice from Muad’Dib.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8473">
				<i class="calibre2">Muad’Dib from whom all blessings flow,</i> he
				thought, and it was the bitterest thought of his life.

				<i class="calibre2">But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad</i

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8474">
				Stilgar cleared his throat, said: “Rabban, too, is dead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8475">Paul nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8476">
				Guards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to
				open an aisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint
				of striding across sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to
				her something of what she had once been here&mdash;concubine to a ruling
				duke. Her presence carried some of its old assertiveness.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8477">
				Jessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his
				fatigue and how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8478">
				Jessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8485">
				Jessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him.
				<i class="calibre2">Was it his child’s death did this?</i> she wondered.
				And she said: “The men tell strange stories of you, Paul. They say

				“How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?” Paul
				asked. “There’s a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8489">
				Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said: “Once you

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8492">
				“Paul!” Jessica snapped. “Don’t make the mistake your father made!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8493">
				“She’s a princess,” Paul said. “She’s my key to the throne, and that’s
				all she’ll ever be. Mistake? You think because I’m what you made me that
				I cannot feel the need for revenge?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8494">
				“Even on the innocent?” she asked, and she thought:
				<i class="calibre2">He must not make the mistakes I made.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8495">
				“There are no innocent anymore,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8496">
				“Tell that to Chani,” Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from
				the rear of the Residency.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8497">
				Chani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as
				though unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back,
				face mask fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she
				crossed the room to stand beside Jessica.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8498">
				Paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks&mdash;<i class="calibre2"
					>She gives water to the dead</i
				>. He felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he
				could only feel this thing through Chani’s presence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8499">
				“He is dead, beloved,” Chani said. “Our son is dead.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8500">
				Holding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached
				out, touched Chani’s cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. “He
				cannot be replaced,” Paul said, “but there will be other sons. It is
				Usul who promises this.” Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to
				Stilgar.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8501">“Muad’Dib,” Stilgar said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8502">
				<span

				>“They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people,” Paul said. “I
				will stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in the center of
				the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I
				command otherwise.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8504">“As you command, Muad’Dib.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8505">
				As Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen
				guards: “You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8506">
				The Emperor’s entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar
				humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came
				a murmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the
				guard, crossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul’s side, a
				strange look in his eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8507">
				<i class="calibre2">Will I lose Gurney, too?</i> Paul wondered.
				<i class="calibre2"
					>The way I lost Stilgar&mdash;losing a friend to gain a creature?</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8508">
				“They have no throwing weapons,” Gurney said. “I’ve made sure of that
				myself.” He glanced around the room, seeing Paul’s preparations.
				“Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8509">“Leave him.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8510">
				“There’re some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges,
				threatening an embargo against Arrakis. I told them I’d give you their
				message.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8511">“Let them threaten.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8512">
				“Paul!” Jessica hissed behind him. “He’s talking about the Guild!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8513">
				“I’ll pull their fangs presently,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8514">
				And he thought then about the Guild&mdash;the force that had specialized
				for so long that it had become a parasite,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8515"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="767"></span
				>unable to exist independently of the life upon which it fed. They had
				never dared grasp the sword…and now they could not grasp it. They might
				have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the
				melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators. They
				<i class="calibre2">could</i> have done this, lived their glorious day
				and died. Instead, they’d existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas
				in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8516">
				The Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal
				decision: they’d chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever
				downward into stagnation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8517">
				<i class="calibre2">Let them look closely at their new host,</i> Paul
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8518">
				“There’s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she’s a friend of
				your mother,” Gurney said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8519">
				“My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8520">
				Again, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul’s
				ear. “Thufir Hawat’s with ’em, m’Lord. I had no chance to see him alone,
				but he used our old hand signs to say he’s been working with the
				Harkonnens, thought you were dead. Says he’s to be left among ’em.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8521">
				“You left Thufir among those&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8522">
				“He wanted it…and I thought it best. If…there’s something wrong, he’s
				where we can control him. If not&mdash;we’ve an ear on the other side.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8523">
				Paul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this
				moment&mdash;and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle
				which the Emperor commanded he use against “this upstart Duke.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8524">
				The entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8525"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="768"></span
				>corridor of lances. There came a murmurous swish of garments, feet
				rasping the sand that had drifted into the Residency.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8526">
				The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His Burseg
				helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His
				uniform’s left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was
				beltless and without weapons, but his presence moved with him like a
				force-shield bubble that kept his immediate area open.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8527">
				A Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had
				ordered. The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling
				and of staring faces.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8528">
				Paul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of
				weeping, saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a
				Sardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw
				the bird-bright eyes of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring
				beneath her black hood, and beside her the narrow furtiveness of
				Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8529">
				<i class="calibre2">There’s a face time betrayed to me,</i> Paul
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8530">
				He looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing there
				a narrow, weaselish face he’d never before encountered&mdash;not in time
				or out of it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling
				carried with it a marker of fear.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8531">
				<i class="calibre2">Why should I fear that man?</i> he wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8532">
				He leaned toward his mother, whispered: “That man to the left of the
				Reverend Mother, the evil-looking one&mdash;who is that?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8533">
				Jessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke’s
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8534"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="769"></span
				>dossiers. “Count Fenring,” she said. “The one who was here immediately
				before us. A genetic-eunuch…and a killer.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8535">
				<i class="calibre2">The Emperor’s errand boy,</i> Paul thought. And the
				thought was a shock crashing across his consciousness because he had
				seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible
				futures&mdash;but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those
				prescient visions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8536">
				It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along
				countless reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment
				of death.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8537">
				<i class="calibre2"
					>Have I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who
					kills me?</i
				>
				Paul wondered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8538">
				The thought sent a pang of foreboding through him. He forced his
				attention away from Fenring, looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men
				and officers, the bitterness on their faces and the desperation. Here
				and there among them, faces caught Paul’s attention briefly: Sardaukar
				officers measuring the preparations within this room, planning and
				scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8539">
				Paul’s attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, green-eyed, a face
				of patrician beauty, classic in its hauteur, untouched by tears,
				completely undefeated. Without being told it, Paul knew
				her&mdash;Princess Royal, Bene Gesserit-trained, a face that time-vision
				had shown him in many aspects: Irulan.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8540">
				<i class="calibre2">There’s my key,</i> he thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8541">
				Then he saw movement in the clustered people, a face and figure
				emerged&mdash;Thufir Hawat, the seamed old features
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8542"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="770"></span
				>with darkly stained lips, the hunched shoulders, the look of fragile
				age about him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8543">
				“There’s Thufir Hawat,” Paul said. “Let him stand free, Gurney.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8544">“M’Lord,” Gurney said.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8545">
				“Let him stand free,” Paul repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8546">Gurney nodded.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8547">
				Hawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind
				him. The rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8548">
				Paul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the
				Emperor and his people.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8549">
				Hawat’s gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man said: “Lady Jessica, I
				but learned this day how I’ve wronged you in my thoughts. You needn’t
				forgive.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8550">
				Paul waited, but his mother remained silent.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8551">
				“Thufir, old friend,” Paul said, “as you can see, my back is toward no
				door.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8552">
				“The universe is full of doors,” Hawat said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8553">
				“Am I my father’s son?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8554">
				“More like your grandfather’s,” Hawat rasped. “You’ve his manner and the
				look of him in your eyes.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8555">
				“Yet I’m my father’s son,” Paul said. “For I say to you, Thufir, that in
				payment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything
				you wish of me. Anything at all. Do you need my life now, Thufir? It is
				yours.” Paul stepped forward a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look
				of awareness grow in Hawat’s eyes.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8556">
				<i class="calibre2">He realizes that I know of the treachery,</i> Paul
				thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8557">
				Pitching his voice to carry in a half-whisper for Hawat’s
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8558"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="771"></span
				>ears alone, Paul said: “I mean this, Thufir. If you’re to strike me, do
				it now.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8559">
				“I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke,” Hawat said. And
				Paul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted
				to keep from falling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the
				shoulders, feeling the muscle tremors beneath his hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8560">
				“Is there pain, old friend?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8561">
				“There is pain, my Duke,” Hawat agreed, “but the pleasure is greater.”
				He half turned in Paul’s arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward
				the Emperor, exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. “See,
				Majesty?” he called. “See your traitor’s needle? Did you think that I
				who’ve given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less
				now?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8562">
				Paul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms, felt the death there,
				the utter flaccidity. Gently, Paul lowered Hawat to the floor,
				straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8563">
				Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8564">
				A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor’s face now. Eyes that had
				never admitted fear admitted it at last.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8565">
				“Majesty,” Paul said, and noted the jerk of surprised attention in the
				tall Princess Royal. The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit
				controlled atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn
				that Paul could put there.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8566">
				<i class="calibre2">Bene Gesserit-trained indeed,</i> Paul thought.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8567">
				The Emperor cleared his throat, said: “Perhaps my
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8568"

					title="772"></span
				>respected kinsman believes he has things all his own way now. Nothing
				could be more remote from fact. You have violated the Convention, used
				atomics against&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8569">
				“I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert,” Paul said. “It
				was in my way and I was in a hurry to get to you, Majesty, to ask your
				explanation for some of your strange activities.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8570">
				“There’s a massed armada of the Great Houses in space over Arrakis right
				now,” the Emperor said. “I’ve but to say the word and they’ll&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8571">
				“Oh, yes,” Paul said, “I almost forgot about them.” He searched through
				the Emperor’s suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen, spoke
				aside to Gurney. “Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones
				dressed in gray over there?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8572">“Yes, m’Lord.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8573">
				“You two,” Paul said, pointing. “Get out of there immediately and
				dispatch messages that will get that fleet on its way home. After this,
				you’ll ask my permission before&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8574">
				“The Guild doesn’t take your orders!” the taller of the two barked. He
				and his companion pushed through to the barrier lances, which were
				raised at a nod from Paul. The two men stepped out and the taller
				leveled an arm at Paul, said: “You may very well be under embargo for
				your&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8575">
				“If I hear any more nonsense from either of you,” Paul said, “I’ll give
				the order that’ll destroy all spice production on Arrakis…forever.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8576">
				“Are you mad?” the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8577">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8578"

				>“You grant that I have the power to do this thing, then?” Paul asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8579">
				The Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: “Yes, you
				could do it, but you must not.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8580">
				“Ah-h-h,” Paul said and nodded to himself. “Guild navigators, both of
				you, eh?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8581">“Yes!”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8582">
				The shorter of the pair said: “You would blind yourself, too, and
				condemn us all to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be
				deprived of the spice liquor once you’re addicted?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8583">
				“The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever,” Paul
				said. “The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on
				their isolated planets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure
				spite…or out of ennui.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8584">
				“Let us talk this over privately,” the taller Guildsman said. “I’m sure
				we can come to some compromise that is&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8585">
				“Send the message to your people over Arrakis,” Paul said. “I grow tired
				of this argument. If that fleet over us doesn’t leave soon there’ll be
				no need for us to talk.” He nodded toward his communications men at the
				side of the hall. “You may use our equipment.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8586">
				“First we must discuss this,” the tall Guildsman said. “We cannot
				just&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8587">
				“Do it!” Paul barked. “The power to destroy a thing is the absolute
				control over it. You’ve agreed I have that power. We are not here to
				discuss or to negotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or
				suffer the <i class="calibre2">immediate</i> consequences!”

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8590">
				Slowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8591">
				“Will they obey?” Gurney asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8592">
				“They have a narrow vision of time,” Paul said. “They can see ahead to a
				blank wall marking the consequences of disobedience. Every Guild
				navigator on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall.
				They’ll obey.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8593">
				Paul turned back to look at the Emperor, said: “When they permitted you
				to mount your father’s throne, it was only on the assurance that you’d
				keep the spice flowing. You’ve failed them, Majesty. Do you know the
				consequences?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8594">
				“Nobody <i class="calibre2">permitted</i> me to&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8595">
				“Stop playing the fool,” Paul barked. “The Guild is like a village
				beside a river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they
				require. They cannot dam the river and control it, because that focuses
				attention on what they take, it brings down eventual destruction. The
				spice flow, that’s their river, and I have built a dam. But my dam is
				such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8596">
				The Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of
				the two Guildsmen.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8597">
				“Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling,” Paul said. “There are
				other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once
				they’ve used the spice liquor, the others no longer work.”
			</p>

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8600">
				“Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,” Paul said. “It has been a long

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8601">
				She looked past him at his mother, said: “Well, Jessica, I see that your

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8602">
				Paul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: “You’ve never had the right

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8603">
				The old woman locked eyes with him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8604">
				“Try your tricks on me, old witch,” Paul said. “Where’s your gom jabbar?

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8681">
				The Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the
				thick muscles. He turned to look at Paul&mdash;a stringy whipcord of a

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8682">
				Jessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: “One

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8685">
				Jessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8687">
				“Is it this religious prattle?” Gurney insisted.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8688">
				“Be silent,” Jessica whispered. “And pray.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8689">
				The Emperor’s face was touched by an abrupt smile. “If Feyd-Rautha
				Harkonnen…of my entourage…so wishes,” he said, “I relieve him of all
				restraint and give him freedom to choose his own course in this.” The
				Emperor waved a hand toward Paul’s Fedaykin guards. “One of your rabble

				with my blade in his hand.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8690">
				“I wish it,” Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man’s

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8691">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8692">
				“Get the Emperor’s blade,” Paul said, and watched as his command was

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8693">
				A flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8694">
				<i class="calibre2">They’re accustomed to seeing the future,</i> Paul

				<i class="calibre2"

				of humans had felt its own dormancy, sensed itself grown stale and knew
				now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle
				and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans were alive as an
				unconscious single organism in this moment, experiencing a kind of
				sexual heat that could override any barrier.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8696">
				And Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest
				bit of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the
				jihad would be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without
				him. They needed only the legend he already had become. He had shown
				them the way, given them mastery even over the Guild which must have the
				spice to exist.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8697">
				A sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8698">

				to power opening before him because the Emperor surely would reward
				whoever killed this troublesome Duke. The reward might even be that
				haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel Duke, this
				back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen

				“Shall we fight, cousin?” Paul asked. And he cat-footed forward, eyes on

				Paul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8728">
				Paul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the
				tone of unease in Feyd-Rautha’s voice, evidence that the pressure of
				silence was building.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8729">
				“You smile, eh?” Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in midsentence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8730">
				Expecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the
				downflash of blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the
				sudden pain there, his mind flooded with
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8731"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="787"></span
				>realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick&mdash;an
				overfeint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There
				would be tricks within tricks within tricks.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8732">
				“Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my skills,” Feyd-Rautha said.
				“He gave me first blood. Too bad the old fool didn’t live to see it.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8733">
				And Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, “<i class="calibre2"
					>Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you’ll never be
					surprised.”</i
				>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8734">
				Again the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8735">
				Paul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a
				scratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the
				blade! But how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon,
				snooped it before passing it. They were too well trained to miss an
				obvious thing like that.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8736">
				“That woman you were talking to over there,” Feyd-Rautha said. “The
				little one. Is she something special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she
				deserve my special attentions?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8737">
				Paul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood
				from the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor’s blade.
				He realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the
				molecules of the soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They’d been
				prepared with soporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a
				poison snooper, but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched. His
				enemies had their own plans within plans, their own stacked treacheries.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8738">
				Again Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8739">
				Paul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with slowness
				<span

					title="788"></span
				>as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet
				the downflashing arm on the crysknife’s point.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8741">
				Feyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to
				his left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw
				betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8742">
				<i class="calibre2">Let him know his own moment of doubt,</i> Paul
				thought. <i class="calibre2">Let him suspect poison.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8743">
				“Treachery!” Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s poisoned me! I do feel poison in
				my arm!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8744">
				Paul dropped his cloak of silence, said: “Only a little acid to counter
				the soporific on the Emperor’s blade.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8745">
				Feyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a
				mock salute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8746">
				Paul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent.
				Again, they circled, probing.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8747">
				Feyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held
				high, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted
				right and under, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands
				gripped, straining.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8748">
				Paul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha’s right hip where he suspected a poison
				flip-dart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the
				needle point flick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in
				Feyd-Rautha’s motion warned him. The tiny point missed Paul’s flesh by
				the barest fraction.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8749">
				<i class="calibre2">On the left hip!</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8750">

				Paul reminded

				>himself. Using Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a
				reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point
				jutting from his opponent’s hip threw Paul off just enough that he
				missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to the floor,
				Feyd-Rautha on top.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8752">
				“You see it there on my hip?” Feyd-Rautha whispered. “Your death, fool.”
				And he began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer
				and closer. “It’ll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you.
				There’ll be never a trace left to detect!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8753">
				Paul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped
				ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to
				save himself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8754">
				“I will not say it!” Paul gasped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8755">
				Feyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation.
				It was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his
				opponent’s leg muscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd-Rautha
				lay partly underneath with right hip high, unable to turn because of the
				tiny needle point caught against the floor beneath him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8756">
				Paul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from
				his arm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha’s jaw. The point
				slid home into the brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held
				partly on his side by the needle imbedded in the floor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8757">
				Breathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got
				to his feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with
				deliberate slowness to look across the room at the Emperor.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8758">

				wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8760">
				The Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his
				stare&mdash;gray eyes against green. The thought lay there clearly
				between them, their association so long that understanding could be
				achieved with a glance.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8761">
				<i class="calibre2">Kill this upstart for me,</i> the Emperor was

				<i class="calibre2"

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8762">
				Slowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8763">“Do it!” the Emperor hissed.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8764">
				The Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained
				in the Bene Gesserit Way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about
				this Atreides youth.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8765">
				<i class="calibre2">I could kill him,</i> Fenring thought&mdash;and he
				knew this for a truth.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8766">
				Something in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he
				glimpsed briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul&mdash;a
				way of hiding from the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that
				no eye could penetrate.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8767">
				Paul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled,
				understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of
				prescience. Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost-Kwisatz
				Haderach,
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8768"

					title="791"></span
				>crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern&mdash;a eunuch, his talent
				concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion. A deep compassion for
				the Count flowed through Paul, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever
				experienced.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8769">
				Fenring, reading Paul’s emotion, said, “Majesty, I must refuse.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8770">
				Rage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage,
				cuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8771">
				A dark flush spread up and over the Count’s face. He looked directly at
				the Emperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: “We have been
				friends, Majesty. What I do now is out of friendship. I shall forget
				that you struck me.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8772">
				Paul cleared his throat, said: “We were speaking of the throne,
				Majesty.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8773">
				The Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. “I sit on the throne!” he barked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8774">
				“You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus,” Paul said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8775">
				“I put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!” the Emperor
				shouted. “You dare threaten&mdash;”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8776">
				“Your person is safe in my presence,” Paul said. “An Atreides promised

				powers at my disposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle
				things.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8777">
				As the hidden import of Paul’s words grew in the Emperor’s mind, he
				glared across the room at Paul. “Now we see true motives,” he sneered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8778">

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8780">
				“And what of Arrakis?” the Emperor asked. “Another garden world full of
				gentle things?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8781">
				“The Fremen have the word of Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “There will be
				flowing water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good
				things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always
				be desert on Arrakis…and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We
				Fremen have a saying: ‘God created Arrakis to train the faithful.’ One
				cannot go against the word of God.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8782">
				The old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own
				view of the hidden meaning in Paul’s words now. She glimpsed the jihad
				and said: “You cannot loose these people upon the universe!”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8783">
				“You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!” Paul snapped.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8784">“You cannot,” she whispered.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8785">
				“You’re a Truthsayer,” Paul said. “Review your words.” He glanced at the
				Princess Royal, back to the Emperor. “Best be done quickly, Majesty.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8786">
				The Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his
				arm, spoke soothingly: “For this I was trained, Father.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8787">He took a deep breath.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8788">
				“You cannot stay this thing,” the old Truthsayer muttered.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8789">
				The Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered
				dignity. “Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?” he asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8790">
				Paul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy-lidded,
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8791"

					title="793"></span
				>standing with Chani in a squad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them,
				stood looking down at Chani.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8792">
				“I know the reasons,” Chani whispered. “If it must be…Usul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8793">
				Paul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. “My
				Sihaya need fear nothing, ever,” he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced
				his mother. “You will negotiate for me, Mother, with Chani by your side.
				She has wisdom and sharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one
				bargains tougher than a Fremen. She will be looking through the eyes of
				her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be, what they will
				need. Listen to her.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8794">
				Jessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder.
				“What are your instructions?” she asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8795">
				“The Emperor’s entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry,” he said.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8796">
				“Entire?” She was shocked almost speechless.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8797">
				“He is to be stripped. I’ll want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for
				Gurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and
				attendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the
				lowliest trooper.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8798">
				“What of the Fremen?” Jessica asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8799">
				“The Fremen are mine,” Paul said. “What they receive shall be dispensed
				by Muad’Dib. It’ll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that
				can wait.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8800">“And for me?” Jessica asked.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8801">
				“Is there something you wish?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8802">
				“Perhaps Caladan,” she said, looking at Gurney. “I’m not certain. I’ve

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8804">
				“<i class="calibre2">That</i> you shall have,” Paul said, “and anything
				else that Gurney or I can give you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8805">
				Jessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani.
				“And for the royal concubine?”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8806">
				“No title for me,” Chani whispered. “Nothing. I beg of you.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8807">
				Paul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had
				stood once with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this
				violence. “I swear to you now,” he whispered, “that you’ll need no
				title. That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine
				because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this
				moment, enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad. We must obey the
				forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name. No child
				of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8808">
				“So you say now,” Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tall
				princess.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8809">
				“Do you know so little of my son?” Jessica whispered. “See that princess
				standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions
				of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things;
				she’ll have little else.” A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. “Think on it,
				Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she’ll live as less than a
				concubine&mdash;never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to
				whom she’s bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of
				concubine&mdash;history will call us wives.”

				To Pardot Kynes, the planet was merely an expression of energy, a

				language with symbols that arm the mind to manipulate an entire

				all ideas of force into the dazzling awareness of

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8822">
				“There’s an internally recognized beauty of motion and balance on any
				man-healthy planet,” Kynes said. “You see in this beauty a dynamic
				stabilizing effect essential to all life. Its aim is simple: to maintain
				and produce coordinated patterns of greater and greater diversity. Life
				improves the closed system’s capacity to sustain life. Life&mdash;all
				life&mdash;is in the service of life. Necessary nutrients are made

				This was Pardot Kynes lecturing to a sietch warren class.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8824">
				Before the lectures, though, he had to convince the Fremen. To
				understand how this came about, you must first understand the enormous

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8825">
				He was exploring the Arrakis landscape in a one-man groundcar one hot
				afternoon when he stumbled onto a deplorably common scene. Six Harkonnen
				bravos, shielded
				<span

					id="calibre_link-8826"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="799"></span
				>and fully armed, had trapped three Fremen youths in the open behind the
				Shield Wall near the village of Windsack. To Kynes, it was a ding-dong
				battle, more slapstick than real, until he focused on the fact that the
				Harkonnens intended to kill the Fremen. By this time, one of the youths
				was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down as well, but
				it was still four armed men against two striplings.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8827">
				Kynes wasn’t brave; he merely had that single-mindedness and caution.
				The Harkonnens were killing Fremen. They were destroying the tools with
				which he intended to remake a planet! He triggered his own shield, waded
				in and had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip before they knew
				anyone was behind them. He dodged a sword thrust from one of the others,
				slit the man’s throat with a neat <i class="calibre2">entrisseur</i>,
				and left the lone remaining bravo to the two Fremen youths, turning his
				full attention to saving the lad on the ground. And save the lad he
				did…while the sixth Harkonnen was being dispatched.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8828">
				Now here was a pretty kettle of sandtrout! The Fremen didn’t know what
				to make of Kynes. They knew who he was, of course. No man arrived on
				Arrakis without a full dossier finding its way into the Fremen
				strongholds. They knew him: he was an Imperial servant.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8829">But he killed Harkonnens!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8830">
				Adults might have shrugged and, with some regret, sent his shade to join
				those of the six dead men on the ground. But these Fremen were
				inexperienced youths and all they could see was that they owed this
				Imperial servant a mortal obligation.

				and talked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8833">
				All around him raged a debate that Kynes never saw. What to do with this
				madman? He knew the location of a major sietch. What to do? What of his

				too much. But he killed Harkonnens! What of the water burden? When did

				The necessary decision was known for hours before it was voiced. The tau

				It’s doubtful that Kynes even focused on his would-be executioner. He

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8843">
				What went on in that would-be executioner’s mind cannot be known now.
				Did he finally listen to Kynes and believe? Who knows? But what he did
				is a matter of record. Uliet was his name,
				<i class="calibre2">Older</i> Liet. Uliet walked three paces and
				deliberately fell on his own knife, thus “removing” himself. Suicide?
				Some say Shai-hulud moved him.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8844">Talk about omens!</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8845">
				From that instant, Kynes had but to point, saying “Go there.” Entire
				Fremen tribes went. Men died, women died, children died. But they went.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8846">
				Kynes returned to his Imperial chores, directing the Biological Testing
				Stations. And now, Fremen began to appear among the Station personnel.
				The Fremen looked at each other. They were infiltrating the “system,” a
				possibility they’d never considered. Station tools began finding their
				way into the sietch warrens&mdash;especially cutterays which were used
				to dig underground catchbasins and hidden windtraps.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8847">
				Water began collecting in the basins.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8848">
				It became apparent to the Fremen that Kynes was not a madman totally,
				just mad enough to be holy. He was one of the umma, the brotherhood of
				prophets. The shade of Uliet was advanced to the sadus, the throng of
				heavenly judges.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8849">
				Kynes&mdash;direct, savagely intent Kynes&mdash;knew that highly
				organized research is guaranteed to produce

				>nothing new. He set up small-unit experiments with regular interchange

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8851">
				Core samplings were made throughout the bled. Charts were developed on
				the long drifts of weather that are called climate. He found that in the
				wide belt contained by the 70-degree lines, north and south,
				temperatures for thousands of years hadn’t gone outside the
				254&ndash;332 degrees (absolute) range, and that this belt had long
				growing seasons where temperatures ranged from 284 to 302 degrees
				absolute: the “bonanza” range for terraform life…once they solved the
				water problem.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8852">
				When will we solve it? the Fremen asked. When will we see Arrakis as a
				paradise?
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8853">
				In the manner of a teacher answering a child who has asked the sum of 2
				plus 2, Kynes told them: “From three hundred to five hundred years.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8854">
				A lesser folk might have howled in dismay. But the Fremen had learned
				patience from men with whips. It was a bit longer than they had
				anticipated, but they all could see that the blessed day was coming.
				They tightened their sashes and went back to work. Somehow, the
				disappointment made the prospect of paradise more real.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8855">
				The concern on Arrakis was not with water, but with moisture. Pets were
				almost unknown, stock animals rare. Some smugglers employed the
				domesticated desert ass, the kulon, but the water price was high even
				when the beasts were fitted with modified stillsuits.

				>Kynes thought of installing reduction plants to recover water from the
				hydrogen and oxygen locked in native rock, but the energy-cost factor
				was far too high. The polar caps (disregarding the false sense of water
				security they gave the pyons) held far too small an amount for his
				project…and he already suspected where the water had to be. There was
				that consistent increase of moisture at median altitudes, and in certain
				winds. There was that primary clue in the air balance&mdash;23 per cent
				oxygen, 75.4 per cent nitrogen and .023 per cent carbon

				There was a rare native root plant that grew above the 2,500-meter level
				in the northern temperate zone. A tuber two meters long yielded half a

				ones showed signs of thriving if planted in depressions lined with dew
				precipitators.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8859">Then Kynes saw the salt pan.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8860">
				His ’thopter, flying between stations far out on the bled, was blown off

				tasted the pan’s storm-cleaned surface.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8861">Salt.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8862">Now, he was certain.</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8863">
				There’d been open water on Arrakis&mdash;once. He began reexamining the
				evidence of the dry wells where trickles of water had appeared and
				vanished, never to return.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8864">
				Kynes set his newly trained Fremen limnologist to
				<span

					title="804"></span
				>work: their chief clue, leathery scraps of matter sometimes found with
				the spice mass after a blow. This had been ascribed to a fictional
				“sandtrout” in Fremen folk stories. As facts grew into evidence, a
				creature emerged to explain these leathery scraps&mdash;a sandswimmer
				that blocked off water into fertile pockets within the porous lower
				strata below the 280° (absolute) line.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8866">
				This “water-stealer” died by the millions in each spice-blow. A
				five-degree change in temperature could kill it. The few survivors
				entered a semidormant cyst-hibernation to emerge in six years as small
				(about three meters long) sandworms. Of these, only a few avoided their
				larger brothers and pre-spice water pockets to emerge into maturity as
				the giant shai-hulud. (Water is poisonous to shai-hulud as the Fremen
				had long known from drowning the rare “stunted worm” of the Minor Erg to
				produce the awareness-spectrum narcotic they call Water of Life. The
				“stunted worm” is a primitive form of shai-hulud that reaches a length
				of only about nine meters.)
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8867">
				Now they had the circular relationship: little maker to pre-spice mass;
				little maker to shai-hulud; shai-hulud to scatter the spice upon which
				fed microscopic creatures called sand plankton; the sand plankton, food
				for shai-hulud, growing, burrowing, becoming little makers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8868">
				Kynes and his people turned their attention from these great
				relationships and focused now on micro-ecology. First, the climate: the
				sand surface often reached temperatures of 344° to 350° (absolute). A
				foot below ground it might be 55° cooler; a foot above ground, 25°
				cooler. Leaves or black shade could provide another 18°
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8869"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="805"></span
				>of cooling. Next, the nutrients: sand of Arrakis is mostly a product of
				worm digestion; dust (the truly omnipresent problem there) is produced
				by the constant surface creep, the “saltation” movement of sand. Coarse
				grains are found on the downwind sides of dunes. The windward side is
				packed smooth and hard. Old dunes are yellow (oxidized), young dunes are
				the color of the parent rock&mdash;usually gray.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8870">
				Downwind sides of old dunes provided the first plantation areas. The
				Fremen aimed first for a cycle of poverty grass with peatlike hair cilia
				to intertwine, mat and fix the dunes by depriving the wind of its big
				weapon: movable grains.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8871">
				Adaptive zones were laid out in the deep south far from Harkonnen
				watchers. The mutated poverty grasses were planted first along the
				downwind (slipface) of the chosen dunes that stood across the path of
				the prevailing westerlies. With the downwind face anchored, the windward
				face grew higher and higher and the grass was moved to keep pace. Giant
				sifs (long dunes with sinuous crests) of more than 1,500 meters height
				were produced this way.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8872">
				When barrier dunes reached sufficient height, the windward faces were
				planted with tougher sword grasses. Each structure on a base about six
				times as thick as its height was anchored&mdash;“fixed.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8873">
				Now, they came in with deeper plantings&mdash;ephemerals (chenopods,
				pigweeds, and amaranth to begin), then scotch broom, low lupine, vine
				eucalyptus (the type adapted for Caladan’s northern reaches), dwarf
				tamarisk,
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8874"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="806"></span
				>shore pine&mdash;then the true desert growths: candelilla, saguaro, and
				bis-naga, the barrel cactus. Where it would grow, they introduced camel
				sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow bush, sand
				verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8875">
				They turned then to the necessary animal life&mdash;burrowing creatures
				to open the soil and aerate it: kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare,
				sand terrapin…and the predators to keep them in check: desert hawk,
				dwarf owl, eagle and desert owl; and insects to fill the niches these
				couldn’t reach: scorpion, centipede, trapdoor spider, the biting wasp
				and the wormfly…and the desert bat to keep watch on these.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8876">
				Now came the crucial test: date palms, cotton, melons, coffee,
				medicinals&mdash;more than 200 selected food plant types to test and
				adapt.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8877">
				“The thing the ecologically illiterate don’t realize about an
				ecosystem,” Kynes said, “is that it’s a system. A system! A system
				maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep
				in just one niche. A system has order, a flowing from point to point. If
				something dams that flow, order collapses. The untrained might miss that
				collapse until it was too late. That’s why the highest function of
				ecology is the understanding of consequences.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8878">Had they achieved a system?</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8879">
				Kynes and his people watched and waited. The Fremen now knew what he
				meant by an open-end prediction to five hundred years.
			</p>

				>A report came up from the palmaries:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8882">
				At the desert edge of the plantings, the sand plankton is being poisoned
				through interaction with the new forms of life. The reason: protein
				incompatibility. Poisonous water was forming there which the Arrakis
				life would not touch. A barren zone surrounded the plantings and even
				shai-hulud would not invade it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8883">
				Kynes went down to the palmaries himself&mdash;a twenty-thumper trip (in
				a palanquin like a wounded man or Reverend Mother because he never
				became a sandrider). He tested the barren zone (it stank to heaven) and
				came up with a bonus, a gift from Arrakis.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8884">
				The addition of sulfur and fixed nitrogen converted the barren zone to a
				rich plant bed for terraform life. The plantings could be advanced at
				will!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8885">
				“Does this change the timing?” the Fremen asked.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8886">
				Kynes went back to his planetary formulae. Windtrap figures were fairly
				secure by then. He was generous with his allowances, knowing he couldn’t
				draw neat lines around ecological problems. A certain amount of plant
				cover had to be set aside to hold dunes in place; a certain amount for
				foodstuffs (both human and animal); a certain amount to lock moisture in
				root systems and to feed water out into surrounding parched areas.
				They’d mapped the roving cold spots on the open bled by this time. These
				had to be figured into the formulae. Even shai-hulud had a place in the
				charts. He must never be destroyed, else spice wealth would end. But his
				inner digestive “factory,” with its enormous concentrations of aldehydes
				and acids, was a giant source of oxygen. A

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8888">
				He had the Guild to consider. The spice bribe to the Guild for
				preventing weather satellites and other watchers in the skies of Arrakis
				already had reached major proportions.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8889">
				Nor could the Fremen be ignored. Especially the Fremen, with their
				windtraps and irregular landholdings organized around water supply; the
				Fremen with their new ecological literacy and their dream of cycling
				vast areas of Arrakis through a prairie phase into forest cover.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8890">
				From the charts emerged a figure. Kynes reported it. Three per cent. If
				they could get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis
				involved in forming carbon compounds, they’d have their self-sustaining
				cycle.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8891">
				“But how long?” the Fremen demanded.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8892">
				“Oh, that: about three hundred and fifty years.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8893">

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8894">
				The work continued: building, planting, digging, training the children.

			</h1>
			<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-8902">
				<span class="dropcaps">B</span>efore the coming of Muad’Dib, the Fremen
				of Arrakis practiced a religion whose roots in the Maometh Saari are
				there for any scholar to see. Many have traced the extensive borrowings
				from other religions. The most common example is the Hymn to Water, a
				direct copy from the Orange Catholic Liturgical Manual, calling for rain
				clouds which Arrakis had never seen. But there are more profound points
				of accord between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the teachings of
				Bible, Ilm, and Fiqh.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8903">
				Any comparison of the religious beliefs dominant in the Imperium up to
				the time of Muad’Dib must start with the major forces which shaped those
				beliefs:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8904">
				1. The followers of the Fourteen Sages, whose Book was the Orange
				Catholic Bible, and whose views are expressed in the Commentaries and
				other literature produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators.
				(C.E.T.);
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8905">
				2. The Bene Gesserit, who privately denied they were a religious order,
				but who operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual
				mysticism, and whose training, whose symbolism, organization, and
				internal teaching methods were almost wholly religious;
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8906">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8907"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="812"></span
				>3. The agnostic ruling class (including the Guild) for whom religion
				was a kind of puppet show to amuse the populace and keep it docile, and
				who believed essentially that all phenomena&mdash;even religious
				phenomena&mdash;could be reduced to mechanical explanations;
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8908">
				4. The so-called Ancient Teachings&mdash;including those preserved by
				the Zensunni Wanderers from the first, second, and third Islamic
				movements; the Navachristianity of Chusuk, the Buddislamic Variants of
				the types dominant at Lankiveil and Sikun, the Blend Books of the
				Mahayana Lankavatara, the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the
				Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur surviving on Salusa Secundus, the pervasive
				Obeah Ritual, the Muadh Quran with its pure Ilm and Fiqh preserved among
				the pundi rice farmers of Caladan, the Hindu outcroppings found all
				through the universe in little pockets of insulated pyons, and finally,
				the Butlerian Jihad.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8909">
				There <i class="calibre2">is</i> a fifth force which shaped religious
				belief, but its effect is so universal and profound that it deserves to
				stand alone.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8910">
				This is, of course, space travel&mdash;and in any discussion of
				religion, it deserves to be written thus:
			</p>
			<p class="copy" id="calibre_link-8911">SPACE TRAVEL!</p>
			<p class="indent1" id="calibre_link-8912">
				Mankind’s movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion
				during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian
				Jihad. To begin with, early space travel, although widespread, was
				largely unregulated, slow, and uncertain, and, before the Guild
				monopoly, was accomplished by a hodgepodge of methods.
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8913"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="813"></span
				>The first space experiences, poorly communicated and subject to extreme
				distortion, were a wild inducement to mystical speculation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8914">
				Immediately, space gave a different flavor and sense to ideas of
				Creation. That difference is seen even in the highest religious
				achievements of the period. All through religion, the feeling of the
				sacred was touched by anarchy from the outer dark.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8915">
				It was as though Jupiter in all his descendant forms retreated into the
				maternal darkness to be superseded by a female immanence filled with
				ambiguity and with a face of many terrors.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8916">
				The ancient formulae intertwined, tangled together as they were fitted
				to the needs of new conquests and new heraldic symbols. It was a time of
				struggle between beast-demons on the one side and the old prayers and
				invocations on the other.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8917">
				There was never a clear decision.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8918">
				During this period, it was said that Genesis was reinterpreted,
				permitting God to say:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8919">
				“Increase and multiply, and fill the <i class="calibre2">universe</i>,
				and subdue it, and rule over all manner of strange beasts and living
				creatures in the infinite airs, on the infinite earths and beneath
				them.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8920">
				It was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real. The measure of them
				is seen in the fact they never boasted how they grasped the firebrand.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8921">
				Then came the Butlerian Jihad&mdash;two generations of chaos. The god of
				machine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was
				raised:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8922">“Man may not be replaced.”</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8923">
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-8924"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="814"></span
				>Those two generations of violence were a thalamic pause for all
				humankind. Men looked at their gods and their rituals and saw that both
				were filled with that most terrible of all equations: fear over
				ambition.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8925">
				Hesitantly, the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the
				blood of billions began meeting to exchange views. It was a move
				encouraged by the Spacing Guild, which was beginning to build its
				monopoly over all interstellar travel, and by the Bene Gesserit who were
				banding the sorceresses.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8926">
				Out of those first ecumenical meetings came two major developments:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8927">
				1. The realization that all religions had at least one common
				commandment: “Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8928">
				2. The Commission of Ecumenical Translators.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8929">
				C.E.T. convened on a neutral island of Old Earth, spawning ground of the
				mother religions. They met “in the common belief that there exists a
				Divine Essence in the universe.” Every faith with more than a million
				followers was represented, and they reached a surprisingly immediate
				agreement on the statement of their common goal:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8930">
				“We are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of disputant
				religions. That weapon&mdash;the claim to possession of the one and only
				revelation.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8931">
				Jubilation at this “sign of profound accord” proved premature. For more
				than a Standard year, that statement was the only announcement from
				C.E.T. Men spoke bitterly of the delay. Troubadours composed witty,

				The major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild, the

				There was an odd sense of calm as the presses and shigawire imprinters

				The O.C. Bible was denounced as a work produced by “the hubris of

				C.E.T. Chairman Toure Bomoko, a Ulema of the Zensunnis and one of the
				fourteen delegates who never recanted (“The Fourteen Sages” of popular
				history), appeared to admit finally the C.E.T. had erred.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8976">
				“We shouldn’t have tried to create new symbols,” he said. “We should’ve
				realized we weren’t supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted
				belief, that we weren’t supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are
				daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human, yet
				we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled, more
				conforming and oppressive. What is this shadow across the highway of
				Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions endure, that symbols
				endure when their meaning is lost, that there is no summa of all
				attainable knowledge.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8977">
				The bitter double edge in this “admission” did not escape Bomoko’s
				critics and he was forced soon afterward to flee into exile, his life
				dependent upon the Guild’s pledge of secrecy. He reportedly died on
				Tupile, honored and beloved, his last words: “Religion must remain an
				outlet for people who say to themselves, ‘I am not the kind of person I

				The parallel between this and the Kwisatz Haderach is readily seen. The

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-8984">

				With such a tradition, suffering is accepted&mdash;perhaps as

				<span class="dropcaps">B</span>ecause the Bene Gesserit operated for
				centuries behind the blind of a semimystic school while carrying on
				their selective breeding program among humans, we tend to award them
				with more status than they appear to deserve. Analysis of their “trial
				of fact” on the Arrakis Affair betrays the school’s profound ignorance
				of its own role.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9015">
				It may be argued that the Bene Gesserit could examine only such facts as
				were available to them and had no direct access to the person of the
				Prophet Muad’Dib. But the school had surmounted greater obstacles and
				its error here goes deeper.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9016">
				The Bene Gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person
				they labeled “Kwisatz Haderach,” a term signifying “one who can be many
				places at once.” In simpler terms, what they sought was a human with
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9017"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="826"></span
				>mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order

			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9018">
				They were breeding for a super-Mentat, a human computer with some of the
				prescient abilities found in Guild navigators. Now, attend these facts
				carefully:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9019">
				Muad’Dib, born Paul Atreides, was the son of the Duke Leto, a man whose
				bloodline had been watched carefully for more than a thousand years. The
				Prophet’s mother, Lady Jessica, was a natural daughter of the Baron
				Vladimir Harkonnen and carried gene-markers whose supreme importance to
				the breeding program was known for almost two thousand years. She was a
				Bene Gesserit bred and trained, and
				<i class="calibre2">should have been a willing tool of the project.</i>
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9020">
				The Lady Jessica was ordered to produce an Atreides daughter. The plan
				was to inbreed this daughter with Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a nephew of the
				Baron Vladimir, with the high probability of a Kwisatz Haderach from
				that union. Instead, for reasons she confesses have never been
				completely clear to her, the concubine Lady Jessica defied her orders
				and bore a son.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9021">
				This alone should have alerted the Bene Gesserit to the possibility that
				a wild variable had entered their scheme. But there were other far more
				important indications that they virtually ignored:
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9022">
				1. As a youth, Paul Atreides showed ability to predict the future. He
				was known to have had prescient visions that were accurate, penetrating,
				and defied four-dimensional explanation.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9023">
				2. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Proctor who
				tested Paul’s humanity when he
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9024"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="827"></span
				>was fifteen, deposes that he surmounted more agony in the test than any
				other human of record. Yet she failed to make special note of this in
				her report!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9025">
				3. When Family Atreides moved to the planet Arrakis, the Fremen
				population there hailed the young Paul as a prophet, “the voice from the
				outer world.” The Bene Gesserit were well aware that the rigors of such
				a planet as Arrakis with its totality of desert landscape, its absolute
				lack of open water, its emphasis on the most primitive necessities for
				survival, inevitably produces a high proportion of sensitives. Yet this
				Fremen reaction and the obvious element of the Arrakeen diet high in
				spice were glossed over by Bene Gesserit observers.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9026">
				4. When the Harkonnens and the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor
				reoccupied Arrakis, killing Paul’s father and most of the Atreides
				troops, Paul and his mother disappeared. But almost immediately there
				were reports of a new religious leader among the Fremen, a man called
				Muad’Dib, who again was hailed as “the voice from the outer world.” The
				reports stated clearly that he was accompanied by a new Reverend Mother
				of the Sayyadina Rite “who is the woman who bore him.” Records available
				to the Bene Gesserit stated in plain terms that the Fremen legends of
				the Prophet contained these words: “He shall be born of a Bene Gesserit
				witch.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9027">
				(It may be argued here that the Bene Gesserit sent their Missionaria
				Protectiva onto Arrakis centuries earlier to implant something like this
				legend as safeguard should any members of the school be trapped there
				and require sanctuary, and that this legend of “the voice from the outer
				world” was properly to be ignored because it appeared to
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9028"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="828"></span
				>be the standard Bene Gesserit ruse. But this would be true only if you
				granted that the Bene Gesserit were correct in ignoring the other clues
				about Paul-Muad’Dib.)
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9029">
				5. When the Arrakis Affair boiled up, the Spacing Guild made overtures
				to the Bene Gesserit. The Guild hinted that its navigators, who use the
				spice drug of Arrakis to produce the limited prescience necessary for
				guiding spaceships through the void, were “bothered about the future” or
				saw “problems on the horizon.” This could only mean they saw a nexus, a
				meeting place of countless delicate decisions, beyond which the path was
				hidden from the prescient eye. This was a clear indication that some
				agency was interfering with higher order dimensions!
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9030">
				(A few of the Bene Gesserit had long been aware that the Guild could not
				interfere directly with the vital spice source because Guild navigators
				already were dealing in their own inept way with higher order
				dimensions, at least to the point where they recognized that the
				slightest misstep they made on Arrakis could be catastrophic. It was a
				known fact that Guild navigators could predict no way to take control of
				the spice without producing just such a nexus. The obvious conclusion
				was that someone of higher order powers
				<i class="calibre2">was</i> taking control of the spice source, yet the
				Bene Gesserit missed this point entirely!)
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9031">
				In the face of these facts, one is led to the inescapable conclusion

				The Padishah Emperor, 81st of his line (House Corrino) to occupy the
				Golden Lion Throne, reigned from 10,156 (date his father, Elrood IX,
				succumbed to chaumurky) until replaced by the 10,196 Regency set up in
				the name of his eldest daughter, Irulan. His reign is noted chiefly for
				the Arrakis Revolt, blamed by many historians on Shaddam IV’s dalliance
				with Court functions and the pomp of office. The ranks of Bursegs were
				doubled in the first sixteen years of his reign. Appropriations for
				Sardaukar training went down steadily in the final thirty years before
				the Arrakis Revolt. He had five daughters (Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia,
				Josifa, and Rugi) and no legal sons. Four of the daughters accompanied
				him into retirement. His wife, Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank,
				died in 10,176.

				Commonly referred to as Baron Harkonnen, his title is officially Siridar
				(planetary governor) Baron. Vladimir Harkonnen is the direct-line male

			</h1>
			<p class="nonindent1" id="calibre_link-9434">
				<span class="dropcaps">I</span> knew Frank Herbert for more than
				thirty-eight years. He was a magnificent human being, a man of great
				honor and distinction, and the most interesting person at any gathering,
				drawing listeners around him like a magnet. To say he was an
				intellectual giant would be an understatement, since he seemed to
				contain all of the knowledge of the universe in his marvelous mind. He
				was my father, and I loved him deeply.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9435">
				Nonetheless, a son’s journey to understand the legendary author was not
				always a smooth one, as I described in my biography of him,
				<i class="calibre2">Dreamer of Dune</i>. Growing up in Frank Herbert’s
				household, I did not understand his need for absolute silence so that he
				could concentrate, the intense desire he had to complete his important
				writing projects, or the confidence he had that one day his writing
				would be a success, despite the steady stream of rejections that he
				received. To my young eyes, the characters he created in
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> and his other stories were the children of
				his mind, and they competed with me for his affections. In the years it
				took him to write his magnum opus, he spent more time with Paul Atreides
				than he did with me. Dad’s study was off-limits to me, to my sister
				Penny, and to my brother Bruce. In those days, only my mother Beverly
				really understood
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9436"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="869"></span
				>Dad’s complexities. Ultimately, it was through her love for him, and
				the love he gave back to her, that I came to see the nurturing, loving
				side of the man.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9437">
				By that time I was in my mid-twenties, having rebelled against his
				exacting ways for years. When I finally saw the soul of my father and
				began to appreciate him for the care he gave my mother when she was
				terminally ill, he and I became the best of friends. He helped me with
				my own writing career by showing me what editors wanted to see in books;
				he taught me how to construct interesting characters, how to build
				suspense, how to keep readers turning the pages. After perusing an early
				draft of <i class="calibre2">Sidney’s Comet</i> (which would become my
				first published novel), he marked up several pages and then wrote me
				this note: “These pages…show how editing tightens the story. Go now and
				do likewise.” It was his way of telling me that he could open the door
				for me and let me peek through, but I would have to complete the immense
				labors involved with writing myself.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9438">
				Beverly Herbert was the window into Frank Herbert’s soul. He shared that
				reality with millions of readers when he wrote a loving, three-page
				tribute to her at the end of <i class="calibre2">Chapterhouse: Dune</i>,
				describing their life together. His writing companion and intellectual
				equal, she suggested the title for that book, and she died in 1984 while
				he was writing it. Earlier in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, Frank
				Herbert had modeled Lady Jessica Atreides after Beverly Herbert, with
				her dignified, gentle ways of influence, and even her prescient
				abilities, which my mother actually possessed. He also wrote of “Lady
				Jessica’s latent (prophetic) abilities,” and in this he was describing
				my mother, thinking of all the
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9439"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="870"></span
				>amazing paranormal feats she had accomplished in her lifetime. In an
				endearing tone, he often referred to her as his “white witch,” or good
				witch. Similarly, throughout the Dune series, he described the heroic
				Bene Gesserit women as “witches.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9440">
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> is the most admired science fiction novel
				ever written and has sold tens of millions of copies all over the world,
				in more than twenty languages. It is to science fiction what the Lord of
				the Rings trilogy is to fantasy, the most highly regarded, respected
				works in their respective genres. Of course,
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> is not just science fiction. It includes
				strong elements of fantasy and contains so many important layers beneath
				the story line that it has become a mainstream classic. As one dimension
				of this, just look at the cover on the book in your hands, the quiet
				dignity expressed in the artwork.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9441">
				The novel was first published in hardcover in 1965 by Chilton Books,
				best known for their immense auto-repair novels. No other publisher
				would touch the book, in part because of the length of the manuscript.
				They felt it was far too long at 215,000 words, when most novels of the
				day were only a quarter to a third that length.
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> would require immense printing costs and a
				high hardcover price for the time, in excess of five dollars. No science
				fiction novel had ever commanded a retail price that high.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9442">
				Publishers also expressed concern about the complexity of the novel and
				all of the new, exotic words that the author introduced in the
				beginning, which tended to slow the story down. One editor said that he
				could not get through the first hundred pages without becoming
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9443"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="871"></span
				>confused and irritated. Another said that he might be making a huge
				mistake in turning the book down, but he did so anyway.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9444">
				Initial sales of the book were slow, but Frank Herbert’s science
				fiction&ndash;writing peers and readers recognized the genius of the
				work from the beginning, awarding it the coveted Nebula and Hugo awards
				for best novel of the year. It was featured in
				<i class="calibre2">The Whole Earth Catalog</i> and began to receive
				excellent reviews, including one from the
				<i class="calibre2">New York Times</i>. A groundswell of support was
				building.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9445">
				In 1969, Frank Herbert published the first sequel,
				<i class="calibre2">Dune Messiah</i>, in which he warned about the
				dangers of following a charismatic leader and showed the dark side of
				Paul Atreides. Many fans didn’t understand this message, because they
				didn’t want to see their superhero brought down from his pedestal.
				Still, the book sold well, and so did its predecessor. Looking back at
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, it is clear that Dad laid the seeds of the
				troublesome direction he intended to take with his hero, but a lot of
				readers didn’t want to see it. John W. Campbell, the editor of
				<i class="calibre2">Analog</i> who made many useful suggestions when
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> was being serialized, did not like
				<i class="calibre2">Dune Messiah</i> because of this Paul Atreides
				issue.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9446">
				Having studied politics carefully, my father believed that heroes made
				mistakes…mistakes that were simplified by the number of people who
				followed such leaders slavishly. In a foreshadowing epigraph, Frank
				Herbert wrote in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>: “Remember, we speak now
				of the Muad’Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies’ skins,
				the Muad’Dib who denied the conventions
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9447"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="872"></span
				>of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: ‘I am the
				Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.’” And in a dramatic scene, as
				Liet-Kynes lay dying in the desert, he remembered the long-ago words of
				his own father: “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than
				for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.”
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9448">
				By the early 1970s, sales of <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> began to
				accelerate, largely because the novel was heralded as an environmental
				handbook, warning about the dangers of destroying the Earth’s finite
				resources. Frank Herbert spoke to more than 30,000 people at the first
				Earth Day in Philadelphia, and he toured the country, speaking to
				enthusiastic college audiences. The environmental movement was sweeping
				the nation, and Dad rode the crest of the wave, a breathtaking trip.
				When he published <i class="calibre2">Children of Dune</i> in 1976, it
				became a runaway bestseller, hitting every important list in the
				country.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9449">
				<i class="calibre2">Children of Dune</i> was the first science fiction
				novel to become a <i class="calibre2">New York Times</i> bestseller in
				both hardcover and paperback, and sales reached into the millions. After
				that, other science fiction writers began to have their own bestsellers,
				but Frank Herbert was the first to obtain such a high level of
				readership; he brought science fiction out of the ghetto of literature.
				By 1979, <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> itself had sold more than 10
				million copies, and sales kept climbing. In early 1985, shortly after
				David Lynch’s movie <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> was released, the
				paperback version of the novel reached #1 on the
				<i class="calibre2">New York Times</i> bestseller list. This was a
				phenomenal accomplishment, occurring twenty years after its first
				publication, and sales remain brisk today.

				write a magazine article about a U.S. Department of Agriculture project
				there, in which the government had successfully planted poverty grasses
				on the crests of sand dunes, to keep them from inundating highways. He
				intended to call the article “They Stopped the Moving Sands,” but soon
				realized that he had a much bigger story on his hands.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9454">
				Frank Herbert’s life experiences are layered into the pages of the Dune
				series, combined with an eclectic assortment of fascinating ideas that
				sprang from his researches. Among other things, the Dune universe is a
				spiritual melting pot, a far future in which religious beliefs have
				combined into interesting forms. Discerning readers will recognize
				Buddhism, Sufi Mysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism,
				Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism. In the San Francisco Bay Area, my
				father even knew Zen Master Alan Watts, who lived on an old ferryboat.
				Dad drew on a variety of religious influences, without adhering to any
				one of them. Consistent with this, the stated purpose of the Commission
				of Ecumenical Translators, as described in an appendix to
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, was to eliminate arguments between
				religions, each of which claimed to have “the one and only revelation.”
			</p>

				When he was a boy, eight of Dad’s Irish Catholic aunts tried to force

				During the 1950s, Frank Herbert was a political speechwriter and
				publicity writer for U.S. senatorial and congressional candidates. In
				that decade, he also journeyed twice to Mexico with his family, where he
				studied desert conditions and crop cycles, and was subjected unwittingly
				to the effects of a hallucinogenic drug. All of those experiences, and a
				great deal from his childhood, found their way onto the pages of
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i>. The novel became as complex and
				multilayered as Frank Herbert himself.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9458">
				As I wrote in <i class="calibre2">Dreamer of Dune</i>, the characters in
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> fit mythological archetypes. Paul is the
				hero prince on a quest who weds the daughter of a “king” (he marries
				Princess Irulan, whose father is the Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV).
				Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is a witch mother archetype, while
				Paul’s sister Alia is a virgin witch, and Pardot Kynes is the wise old
				man of Dune mythology. Beast Rabban Harkonnen, though evil and
				aggressive, is essentially a fool.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9459">
				For the names of heroes, Frank Herbert selected from Greek mythology and
				other mythological bases. The Greek House Atreus, upon which House
				Atreides in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> was based, was the ill-fated
				family of kings Menelaus and Agamemnon. A heroic family, it was beset by
				tragic flaws and burdened with a curse pronounced against it by
				Thyestes. This foreshadows the troubles Frank Herbert had in mind for
				the Atreides family. The evil Harkonnens of
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> are related to the Atreides by blood, so
				when they assassinate Paul’s father Duke Leto,
				<span

				household of Agamemnon when he was murdered by his wife Clytemnestra.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9461">
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar
				myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of
				melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the
				finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious
				worms that are like dragons of lore, with “great teeth” and a “bellows
				breath of cinnamon.” This resembles the myth described by an unknown
				English poet in <i class="calibre2">Beowulf</i>, the compelling tale of
				a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair
				under cliffs, at the edge of the sea.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9462">
				The desert of Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean of sand,
				with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed
				domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there
				are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis,
				life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea;
				similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans.
				Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and
				extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely
				alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren’t so
				different from systems we know…and the book characters of his
				imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.

				Paul Atreides (who is the messianic “Muad’Dib” to the Fremen) resembles
				Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), a British citizen who led Arab

				lines, and came close to becoming a messiah figure for the Arabs. This
				historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the possibility of an
				outsider leading native forces against the morally corrupt occupiers of
				a desert world, in the process becoming a godlike figure to them.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9465">
				One time I asked my father if he identified with any of the characters
				in his stories, and to my surprise he said it was Stilgar, the rugged
				leader of the Fremen. I had been thinking of Dad more as the dignified,
				honorable Duke Leto, or the heroic, swashbuckling Paul, or the loyal
				Duncan Idaho. Mulling this over, I realized Stilgar was the equivalent
				of a Native American chief in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>&mdash;a
				person who represented and defended time-honored ways that did not harm
				the ecology of the planet. Frank Herbert was that, and a great deal
				more. As a child, he had known a Native American who hinted that he had
				been banished from his tribe, a man named Indian Henry who taught my
				father some of the ways of his people, including fishing, the
				identification of edible and medicinal plants in the forest, and how to
				find red ants and protein-rich grub worms for food.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9466">
				When he set up the desert planet of Arrakis and the galactic empire
				encompassing it, Frank Herbert pitted western culture against primitive
				culture and gave the nod to the latter. In
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> he wrote, “Polish comes from the cities;
				wisdom from the desert.” (Later, in his mainstream novel
				<i class="calibre2">Soul Catcher</i>, he would do something similar and
				would favor old ways over modern ways.) Like the nomadic Bedouins of the
				Arabian plateau, the Fremen
				<span

					title="878"></span
				>live an admirable, isolated existence, separated from civilization by
				vast stretches of desert. The Fremen take psychedelic drugs during
				religious rites, like the Navajo Indians of North America. And like the
				Jews, the Fremen have been persecuted, driven to hide from authorities
				and survive away from their homeland. Both Jews and Fremen expect to be
				led to the promised land by a messiah.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9468">
				The words and names in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> are from many
				tongues, including Navajo, Latin, Chakobsa (a language found in the
				Caucasus), the Nahuatl dialect of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, East
				Indian, Russian, Turkish, Finnish, Old English, Spanish, and, of course,
				Arabic.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9469">
				In <i class="calibre2">Children of Dune</i>, Leto II allowed sandtrout
				to attach themselves to his body, and this was based in part upon my
				father’s own experiences as a boy growing up in Washington State, when
				he rolled up his trousers and waded into a stream or lake, permitting
				leeches to attach themselves to his legs.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9470">
				The legendary life of the divine superhero Muad’Dib is based on themes
				found in a variety of religious faiths. Frank Herbert even used lore and
				bits of information from the people of the Gobi Desert in Asia, the
				Kalahari Desert in Southwest Africa, and the aborigines of the
				Australian Outback. For centuries such people have survived on very
				small amounts of water, in environments where water is a more precious
				resource than gold.

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9471">
				The Butlerian Jihad, occurring ten thousand years before the events
				described in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, was a war against thinking
				machines who at one time had cruelly enslaved humans. For this reason,
				computers were eventually
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9472"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="879"></span
				>made illegal by humans, as decreed in the Orange Catholic Bible: “Thou
				shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.” The roots of
				the jihad went back to individuals my parents knew, to my mother’s
				grandfather Cooper Landis and to our family friend Ralph Slattery, both
				of whom abhorred machines.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9473">
				Still, there are computers in the Dune universe, long after the jihad.
				As the series unfolds, it is revealed that the Bene Gesserits have
				secret computers to keep track of their breeding records. And the
				Mentats of <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, capable of supreme logic, are
				“human computers.” In large part these human calculators were based upon
				my father’s paternal grandmother, Mary Stanley, an illiterate Kentucky
				hill-woman who performed incredible mathematical calculations in her
				head. Mentats were the precursors of <i class="calibre2">Star Trek</i>’s
				Spock, First Officer of the starship
				<i class="calibre2">Enterprise</i>…and Frank Herbert described the
				dangers of thinking machines back in the 1960s, years before Arnold
				Schwarzenegger’s Terminator movies.

				Remarkably, no aliens inhabit the Dune universe. Even the most exotic of
				creatures, the mutant Guild Navigators, are humans. So are the vile
				genetic wizards, the Tleilaxu, and the gholas grown in their flesh vats.
				Among the most unusual humans to spring from Frank Herbert’s
				imagination, the women of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood have a collective
				memory&mdash;a concept based largely upon the writings and teachings of
				Carl Gustav Jung, who spoke of a “collective unconscious,” that
				supposedly inborn set of “contents and modes of behavior” possessed by
				all human beings. These were concepts my father discussed at length with
				Ralph Slattery’s wife Irene, a psychologist

			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9476">
				Frank Herbert’s life reached a crescendo in the years after 1957, when
				he focused his unusual experiences and knowledge on creating his great
				novel. In the massive piles of books he read to research
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, he recalled reading somewhere that ecology
				was the science of understanding consequences. This was not his original
				concept, but as he learned from Ezra Pound, he “made it new” and put it
				in a form that was palatable to millions of people. With a worldview
				similar to that of an American Indian, Dad saw western man inflicting
				himself on the environment, not living in harmony with it.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9477">
				Despite all the work <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> required, my father
				said it was his favorite book to write. He used what he called a
				“technique of enormous detail,” in which he studied and prepared notes
				over a four-year period, between 1957 and 1961, then wrote and rewrote
				the book between 1961 and 1965.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9478">
				As Dad expanded and contracted the manuscript, depending upon which
				editor was giving him advice, an error found its way into the final
				manuscript. The age of Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV is slightly
				inconsistent in the novel, but it is one of the few glitches in the
				entire Dune series. This is remarkable, considering the fact that Frank
				Herbert wrote the books on typewriters…more than a million words without
				the use of a computer to keep all of the information straight.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9479">
				Late in 1961, in the midst of his monumental effort, Dad fired his
				literary agent Lurton Blassingame, because he didn’t feel the agent was
				supportive enough and
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9480"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="881"></span
				>because he couldn’t bear the thought of sending any more stories into
				the New York publishing industry, which had been rejecting him for
				years. A couple of years later, when the new novel was nearly complete,
				he got back together with Blassingame and went through the ordeal of
				rejection after rejection&mdash;more than twenty of them&mdash;until
				Chilton finally picked up the book and paid an advance of $7,500 for it.
				If not for a farsighted editor at Chilton, Sterling Lanier,
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> might never have been published, and world
				literature would be the poorer for it.

			<p class="nonindent" id="calibre_link-9482">
				<span class="dropcaps">W</span>hen my father and I became close in my
				adulthood and we began to write together, he spoke to me often of the
				importance of detail, of density of writing. A student of psychology, he
				understood the subconscious, and liked to say that
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> could be read on any of several layers that
				were nested beneath the adventure story of a messiah on a desert planet.
				Ecology is the most obvious layer, but alongside that are politics,
				religion, philosophy, history, human evolution, and even poetry.
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> is a marvelous tapestry of words, sounds,
				and images. Sometimes he wrote passages in poetry first, which he
				expanded and converted to prose, forming sentences that included
				elements of the original poems.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9483">
				Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel’s layers as you read
				it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely
				different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose
				ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story
				with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9484"

				>they would want to go back and read it again. A neat trick, and he
				pulled it off perfectly.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9485">
				As his eldest son, I see familial influences in the story. Earlier, I
				noted that my mother is memorialized in <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> and
				so is Dad. He must have been thinking of himself when he wrote that Duke
				Leto’s “qualities as a father have long been overlooked.” The words have
				deep significance to me, because at the time he and I were not getting
				along well at all. I was going through a rebellious teenage phase,
				reacting to the uncompromising manner in which he ruled the household.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9486">
				At the beginning of <i class="calibre2">Dune</i>, Paul Atreides is
				fifteen years old, around the same age I was at the time the book was
				first serialized in <i class="calibre2">Analog</i>. I do not see myself
				much in the characterization of Paul, but I do see Dad in Paul’s father,
				the noble Duke Leto Atreides. In one passage, Frank Herbert wrote: “Yet
				many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene
				Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son…” Late in his life, Dad
				responded to interview questions about my own writing career by saying,
				“The acorn doesn’t fall far from the oak tree.” He often complimented me
				to others, more than he did to me directly. To most of his friends he
				seemed like an extrovert, but in family matters he was often quite the
				opposite, preferring to retire to his study. Frequently, his strongest
				emotions went on the page, so I often feel him speaking to me as I read
				his stories.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9487">
				Once, I asked my father if he thought his magnum opus would endure. He
				said modestly that he didn’t know and that the only valid literary
				critic was time. <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> was first published in
				1965, and Frank Herbert would be
				<span
					type="pagebreak"
					id="calibre_link-9488"
					role="doc-pagebreak"
					title="883"></span
				>pleased to know that interest in his fantastic novel, and the series it
				spawned, has never waned. An entire new generation of readers is picking
				up <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> and enjoying it, just as their parents
				did before them.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9489">
				Like our own universe, the universe of Dune continues to expand. Frank
				Herbert wrote six novels in the series, and I have written thirteen more
				in collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson, including the chronological
				grand finale that millions of fans were awaiting, the uncompleted
				project my father called “Dune 7.” He was working on that project when
				he died in 1986, and it would have been the third book in a trilogy he
				began with <i class="calibre2">Heretics of Dune</i> and
				<i class="calibre2">Chapterhouse: Dune</i>. In those novels he set up a
				great mystery, and years after his death the solution was the most
				closely guarded secret in science fiction… a solution that Kevin and I
				wrote in two novels: <i class="calibre2">Hunters of Dune</i> and
				<i class="calibre2">Sandworms of Dune</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="indent" id="calibre_link-9490">
				Right now there are nineteen Dune novels (plus one non-canon novel),
				along with the 1984 movie directed by David Lynch, and two television
				miniseries that followed Frank Herbert’s plotline more
				closely&mdash;“Frank Herbert’s Dune” and “Frank Herbert’s Children of
				Dune” (including the <i class="calibre2">Dune Messiah</i> story line).
				As I write this early in 2019, a major new movie of
				<i class="calibre2">Dune</i> is being undertaken by Legendary Pictures,
				with a top Hollywood director and an exciting A-list cast. I am one of
				the executive producers, and I’ve done consultation work on the script.
				The novel Dune is such a massive story that it will now be filmed in two
				major motion pictures, each covering around half of the book. A Dune
				tabletop game has also been announced, and I have consulted on that as
				well. There are additional projects underway that have not yet been
				announced, but when they are it will become clear that Dune has finally
				become the franchise it has always deserved to be.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				Every new project must measure up to the lofty standard my father
				established with his own novels. When all of the good stories have been
				told, there might be no more new books, film productions, or other
				emerging projects. But that will not really be a conclusion, because
				fans can always go back to <i class="calibre2">Dune</i> itself and read
				it again and again… this beloved novel that will be read for centuries
				to come.
