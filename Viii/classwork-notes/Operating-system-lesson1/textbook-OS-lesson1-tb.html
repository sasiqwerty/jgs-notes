		<p>
			As you all know, a computer is a useful machine that works with an
			interaction of hardware and software. Hardware and software are
			interdependent with each other. A hardware needs a software to operate and
			a software cannot be utilised without the supporting hardware.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can see and
			touch, such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, and the other components
			fixed inside the CPU cabinet. Software refers to the instructions or
			programs that tells a hardware what to do. Software enhances the
			capability of the hardware and directs the computer to perform specific
			types of activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em
				>A mobile phone is a hardware and all the applications it has are called
				software. Without the applications, mobile phone is simply a plastic
				case and without the hardware (mobile phone), these applications cannot
				be used.</em

		</p>

		<p>
			There are two types of software: System software and Application software.
		</p>
		<p>
			A system software is a collection of programs that helps to run a
			computer's hardware and the other programs. It manages the hardware
			resources and the other application software. It reads the data from the
			input devices and transfers the processed information to the output
			devices. Common examples of system software are: Operating System
			(Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, Android, etc.), Utility Software (Disk
			Cleanup, Backup, Compression), Language Processor, and Device Drivers.
		</p>
		<p>
			An application software is used to perform the specific types of jobs,
			like doing calculations, arranging data in an organised manner, designing
			professional documents, creating images, logos, etc. Word, PowerPoint, 3D
			Paint, Excel, are some commonly used application software.
		</p>
		<h2>Operating System</h2>
		<p>
			Being a machine, a computer cannot do anything on its own. It requires a
			specific instruction to perform each and every task. Further, the
			instructions are converted into a language, which a machine understands.
			It means that the user cannot communicate with a computer directly. An
			interface is required between the user and computer hardware.
		</p>
		<p>
			The operating system acts as an interface between the user and computer
			hardware. The computer interprets the instructions given by the user with
			the help of an operating system. It controls and manages the overall
			operations and internal working of a computer system. It is the main
			software that makes a computer work and also provides a platform for
			running an application software. Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS DOS),
			Microsoft Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Red Hat) and UNIX (macOS, Solaris, and
			AIX) are examples of operating systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em
				>The working of an operating system is just like a school principal. A
				principal has various responsibilities to perform, such as managing the
				school, supervising teachers, maintaining discipline, analysing the
				examination schedule, timetable, curriculum, meeting parents, and so on.
				Likewise, a number of services is provided by an operating system.
				Imagine, what will happen if there is no principal in a school.
				Everything will become unorganised. Similarly, if there is no operating
				system in a computer, it will not be able to perform any operation for
				you.</em

		</p>
		<h2>Need for an Operating System</h2>
		<p>
			Earlier, programmers had to design the application in accordance with the
			internal hardware structure of a computer. The operating system was needed
			to allow the programmers to design the applications without any details on
			the internal structure of the computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			An operating system acts as a central coordinator between hardware and
			software. It manages the overall resources, resolves conflicts, and tries
			to optimise the performance of the system.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you turn on your computer system, the Basic Input Output System
			(BIOS) starts up your computer and checks whether all of the attachments
			are in place and operational. Then, it loads the operating system into
			your computer's main memory (RAM) from the hard disk drive. After loading
			of the operating system, the application or utility software empowers the
			user to perform a variety of functions on the computer, such as solving
			problems, creating documents, playing games, etc.
		</p>
		<h2>Functions of an Operating System</h2>
		<p>Following are the major functions of an operating system:</p>

		<h4>Operating System</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Process Management</li>
			<li>Memory Management</li>
			<li>Provision of User Interface</li>
			<li>File Management</li>
			<li>Booting and configuring the hardware</li>
			<li>Job Scheduling</li>
			<li>Security and Protection</li>
			<li>Device Management</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Process Management</h3>
		<p>
			This is one of the most important functions of an operating system. The
			operating system ensures that every process or application receives enough
			processor time to function properly. It also tries to use as many
			processor cycles as possible for real-time work. These are the processes
			rather than applications that are controlled, managed, and executed by the
			operating system.
		</p>
		<h3>Memory Management</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system manages the sharing of internal memory among multiple
			applications. It keeps track of the memory used by each process and also
			takes care of the fact that one process should not consume the memory
			allocated to another process. It makes efficient use of different types of
			memory (RAM, Cache, etc.) within the system to ensure proper execution of
			every process.
		</p>
		<h4>Let's Know More</h4>
		<p>
			The bootstrap loader is a small program that loads the operating system
			into memory and allows it to begin its work.
		</p>
		<h3>File Management</h3>
		<p>
			A computer system uses a lot of data, which is stored on the secondary
			storage devices. The operating system keeps track of the information
			regarding the creation, deletion, transfer, copying, and storage of files
			in an organised manner. It also maintains the integrity of the data stored
			in these files, including the file directory structure.
		</p>
		<h3>Device Management</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system plays a very important role in coordinating and
			controlling the various Input/Output (I/O) devices attached to the
			computer system. It receives requests from these devices, performs a
			specific task, and forwards them to the requesting process. That is why,
			it states that an OS handles the I/O operations of a computer system.
		</p>
		<h3>Security and Protection</h3>
		<p>
			The built-in security modules of any operating system protect the
			resources and the information stored on a computer system from the
			unauthorised access.
		</p>
		<h3>Job Scheduling</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system determines and maintains a specific order in which the
			various jobs are executed in the computer system. It takes care of the
			processor time being allocated to the applications based on their
			priority.
		</p>
		<h3>Provision of User Interface</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system provides a systematic user interface that facilitates
			and structures the interaction between the user and a computer. It can
			either be a Character User Interface (CUI) or Graphical User Interface
			(GUI).
		</p>
		<h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
		<p>
			In the past three decades, computers have taken a giant stride towards
			excellence and high performance. From bulky physical configurations,
			computers have miraculously transformed into one of the most powerful, yet
			completely portable devices. Similarly, the operating systems have also
			been developed at a rapid pace to serve the needs of the users. Following
			are the different types of operating systems:
		</p>
		<h3>Single-User, Single-Tasking</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system that allows only a single user to perform only one
			task at a time is known as a single-user, single-tasking operating system.
			It was the initial version of the operating system. A single-user,
			single-tasking operating system occupies less space in memory. Microsoft
			DOS and Palm OS are good examples of modern single-user, single-tasking
			operating systems. Due to their limited features, they are no longer in
			use nowadays.
		</p>
		<h3>Single-User, Multi-Tasking</h3>
		<p>
			An operating system that allows only one user to run several programs at a
			time is called the single-user, multi-tasking operating system. For
			example, a Windows user can write a note in a word processor while
			downloading the file from the internet. This type of operating system is
			commonly used for desktop and laptop computers. Windows, Linux, and macOS
			are some examples of single-user, multi- tasking operating systems.
		</p>
		<h3>Multi-User</h3>
		<p>
			A multi-user operating system allows multiple users to access applications
			or resources that are running on a single network server, concurrently.
			The single network server is termed as a Terminal server. UNIX, Virtual
			Memory System (VMS), and Mainframe OS are examples of the multi-user
			operating systems. It is commonly used in large organisations, such as in
			the government offices, universities, and mainly on servers, such as the
			Ubuntu server or Windows server. These servers allow several users to
			simultaneously access the operating system, applications and the other
			resources.
		</p>
		<h3>Real-Time</h3>
		<p>
			A real-time operating system is designed to handle real-life scenarios and
			problems. Such operating systems have the capability to prioritise the
			processes, minimise the execution time, and work independently with no
			interdependencies. This type of operating system is used when the time
			span required to react to an input is rigid and time-bound. Even a
			microsecond of delay will cause the system to fail. Air traffic control,
			robots, weapons system, and industrial control systems are some examples
			of the real-time operating systems.
		</p>
		<h3>Distributed</h3>
		<p>
			A distributed operating system runs on a set of computers that is located
			in different geographical areas, interconnected by a network. It controls
			these interconnected systems and makes them appear as a single computer.
			It allows all the linked machines to access data and software, and this
			process takes over the common network from different computers,
			irrespective of their location on the globe.
		</p>
		<h2>User Interface</h2>
		<p>
			In computing, the user interface refers to the hardware-software mechanism
			by which a user interacts with the computer to provide instructions. The
			operating system of a computer acts as an interface through which a user
			gives commands or instructions to the computer and also receives messages
			from the computer. Without an operating system, the interaction between a
			user and computer is not possible.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Types of User Interfaces</strong></p>
		<p>
			Following are the two types of the user interfaces that have evolved with
			the advancement in the technology:
		</p>
		<h3>Character User Interface (CUI)</h3>
		<p>
			This type of interface requires the user to type commands in order to
			interact with the computer system. This type of interface is not a good
			choice for the beginners as they have to memorise a good range of
			different commands. Modern computers have a modified version of CUI called
			Command Line Interface (CLI).
		</p>
		<p>
			DOS, Windows Command Prompt, and Unix are the popular examples of CUI.
		</p>

		<h3>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
		<p>
			This type of interface is graphics-based and interactive in nature.
			Different devices, such as mouse, keyboard, etc., are used to interact
			with the system. GUI is more user- friendly as unlike CUI, it does not
			require the user to memorise the commands, instead the user uses different
			menus, dialog boxes, and icons to communicate with the system. Windows is
			the most popular GUI based operating system.
		</p>
		<h2>Advantages of GUI</h2>
		<p>Following are the advantages of GUI over CUI:</p>
		<h3>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GUI is much attractive and appealing.</li>
			<li>
				GUI is easier to learn and more user-friendly due to the presence of the
				various graphical elements, like icons, menu, buttons, etc.
			</li>
			<li>With GUI, a user does not have to learn the complicated commands.</li>
			<li>
				GUI users have Windows that allow a user to work, view, control, and
				manipulate multiple programs and folders at the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				GUI supports the use of both a mouse and keyboard to control and
				navigate through your system.
			</li>
			<li>
				GUI provides immediate visual feedback of the action. For example, the
				user can see immediately that a file is successfully moved from one
				directory to another.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Character User Interface (CUI)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>CUI is relatively less appealing.</li>
			<li>
				CUI is a text-based interface and hence is not as user-friendly as GUI.
			</li>
			<li>
				A user is required to memorise many commands to operate and control a
				CUI.
			</li>
			<li>
				CUI does not offer the same ease and ability to work with multiple
				programs at once on one screen.
			</li>
			<li>CUI supports the use of keyboard only.</li>
			<li>
				CUI does not provide any clear feedback. For example, additional
				commands will have to be issued to confirm that a file has been
				successfully moved from one location to another.
			</li>
			<li>
				Multiple tasks can be performed simultaneously Only one task can be
				executed at a point of time on CUI. particular on the GUI.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			<h4>Let's Know More</h4>
			<p>
				There are two types of real-time operating systems: Hard real-time and
				Soft-real time. Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks are
				completed in time. Soft real-time systems are less restrictive and have
				limited utility than hard real-time systems.
			</p>
			<h4>Know the Fact</h4>
			<p>
				The ability to perform more than one task together at one time is called
				multi-tasking. An operating system, which is capable of doing multiple
				tasks by using a common processing resource, i.e., only one CPU, is
				called the multi-tasking operating system.
			</p>
			<h4>Let's Know More</h4>
			<p>
				Memory, hard disk, and virtual memory are managed better in the
				multi-tasking operating system.
			</p>
			<h4>Know the Fact</h4>
			<p>
				Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is small memory chip on the
				motherboard, which instructs the computer, how to perform basic
				functions, such as booting and configuring the hardware.
