        How Today's Youth Navigate Identity, Intimacy, and Imagination in a
        Digital World
      </p>
      From the famed Harvard psychologist and an expert on the impact of digital
      media technologies, a riveting exploration of the power of apps to shape
      our young people—for better or for worse No one has failed to notice that
      the current generation of youth is deeply—some would say totally—involved
      with digital media. Professors Howard Gardner and Katie Davis name today’s
      young people The App Generation, and in this spellbinding book they
      explore what it means to be “app-dependent” versus “app-enabled” and how
      life for this generation differs from life before the digital era.
      <p>
        Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent
        life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research,
        including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work
        with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions
        before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the
        drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage
        superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On
        the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can
        promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and
        stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that
        apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they
        suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity
        and higher aspirations.
