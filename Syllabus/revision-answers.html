      <h2>Lesson 1 : Hardware Components</h2>
      <h3>Define the following</h3>
      <ol>
        <li
          ><strong>Hardware</strong> : The physical components of a computer
          system which are tangible. <br />
          E.g. Internal Hardware and External Hardware</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Software</strong> : It refers to the set of programs, which
          are required to operate the computer system. <br />
          E.g. System software and Application Software</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>CPU</strong> : A central processing unit (CPU) is the circuit
          that executes instructions of a program. The CPU performs basic
          arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output.</li

      <h3>Write a sentence about the following</h3>
      <ol>
        <li
          ><strong>External Hardware</strong> : The Hardware components which
          are connected to the computer from the outside, these components are
          also known as peripherals
          <br />
          <strong>E.g.</strong> Input, Output and Storage Devices
        </li>
        <li
          ><strong>Internal Hardware</strong> : The Hardware Components which
          are fixed inside the CPU cabinet, and generally harder to remove.
          <br />
          <strong>E.g.</strong> Motherboard, CPU,RAM ,ROM, SMPS, Heat Sink</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>SMPS</strong> : Switched-mode power supply,It is also known
          as the power supply unit. It converts the input high voltage electric
          current to low voltage and supplies it to the motherboard and other
          parts of the computer.
        </li>
        <li
          ><strong>Heat Sink</strong> : It is designed to disperse the heat
          generated by the CPU.</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Modem</strong> : A modulator-demodulator or modem is a
          computer hardware device that converts data from a digital signal into
          an analog signal.</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Serial Port</strong> : A serial port is a serial
          communication interface through which information transfers in or out
          sequentially one bit at a time. This is in contrast to a parallel
          port, which communicates multiple bits simultaneously in parallel.</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Parallel Port</strong> : A parallel port is a type of
          interface for connecting peripherals.The parallel ports send multiple
          bits of data at once.</li
        >
        <li
          ><strong>Microphone</strong> is a transducer that converts sound into
          an electrical signal.
          <ul>
            <li>
              A transducer converts a signal from one form of energy to another.
