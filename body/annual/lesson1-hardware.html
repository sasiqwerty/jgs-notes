    <h1>Hardware Components</h1>
    <p
      >The physical components of a computer that you can touch and feel are
      known as <strong>hardware</strong>.</p
    >
    <p
      ><strong>Software</strong> is a set of programs that instructs a computer
      about the work to be done. <img src="img/concept.jpg" alt="Concept"
    /></p>
    <h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    <p
      >A printed circuit board in general purpose computers,holds and allows
      communication between many crucial electrical components.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/motherboard.jpg" alt="Motherboard" /></p>
    <h3>CPU - Central Processing Unit</h3>
    <p>Electronic circuitry that executes instructions.</p>
    <p
      >The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output
      (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/cpu.svg" alt="CPU" /></p>
    <h3>RAM</h3>
    <p
      >Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and
      changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine
      code.</p
    >
    <p
      >A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in
      almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of
      data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage
      media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes
      and drum memory), where the time required to read and write data items
      varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the
      recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation
      speeds and arm movement.</p
    >
    <h3>ROM</h3>
    <p
      >Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers
      and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be electronically
      modified after the manufacture of the memory device. Read-only memory is
      useful for storing software that is rarely changed during the life of the
      system, also known as firmware.</p
    >
    <h3>Disk Drive</h3>
    <p
      >Disk storage (also sometimes called drive storage) is a general category
      of storage mechanisms where data is recorded by various electronic,
      magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to a surface layer of one or more
      rotating disks. A disk drive is a device implementing such a storage
      mechanism. Notable types are the hard disk drive (HDD) containing a
      non-removable disk, the floppy disk drive (FDD) and its removable floppy
      disk, and various optical disc drives (ODD) and associated optical disc
      media.</p
    >
    <h3>Hard Disk</h3>
    <p
      >A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk, is an
      electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital
      data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating
      platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with
      magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and
      write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access
      manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved
      in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored
      data when powered off.</p
    >
    <h3>SMPS</h3>
    <p
      >A switched-mode power supply (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode
      power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic
      power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical
      power efficiently.</p
    >
    <p
      >Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source
      (often mains power, see AC adapter) to DC loads, such as a personal
      computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a
      linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply
      continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states,
      and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which
      minimizes wasted energy. A hypothetical ideal switched-mode power supply
      dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio
      of on-to-off time (also known as duty cycles). In contrast, a linear power
      supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in
      the pass transistor. The switched-mode power supply's higher electrical
      efficiency is an important advantage.</p
    >
    <h3>Modem</h3>
    <p
      >A modulator-demodulator or modem is a computer hardware device that
      converts data from a digital format into a format suitable for an analog
      transmission medium such as telephone or radio. A modem transmits data by
      modulating one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information,
      while the receiver demodulates the signal to recreate the original digital
      information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted
      easily and decoded reliably. Modems can be used with almost any means of
      transmitting analog signals, from light-emitting diodes to radio.</p

    <h4>External Modem</h4>
    <h3>Heat Sink</h3>
    <p
      >A heat sink (also commonly spelled heatsink) is a passive heat exchanger
      that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device
      to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated
      away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's
      temperature.</p
    >
    <h3>Ports</h3>
    <p
      >In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer
      and other computers or peripheral devices. In computer terms, a port
      generally refers to the part of a computing device available for
      connection to peripherals such as input and output devices. Computer ports
      have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other
      peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a
      specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable
      connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable
      contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices.</p
    >
    <h2>External Hardware</h2>
    <h3>Keyboard</h3>
    <p
      >A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the
      typewriter keyboard which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as
      mechanical levers or electronic switches</p
    >
    <h3>Mouse</h3>
    <p
      >A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects
      two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically
      translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a
      smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.</p
    >
    <h3>Scanner</h3>
    <p
      >An image scanner—often abbreviated to just scanner—is a device that
      optically scans images, printed text, handwriting or an object and
      converts it to a digital image.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/image-scanner.jpg" alt="Image scanner" /></p>
    <h3>Microphone</h3>
    <p
      >A microphone is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical
      signal.</p
    >
    <p
      >A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another.
      Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal
      in another. Transducers are often employed at the boundaries of
      automation, measurement, and control systems, where electrical signals are
      converted to and from other physical quantities (energy, force, torque,
      light, motion, position, etc.). The process of converting one form of
      energy to another is known as transduction</p
    >
    <h3>Light pen</h3>
    <p
      >A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light-sensitive
      wand used in conjunction with a computer's cathode-ray tube (CRT)
      display.</p
    >
    <p
      >It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in
      a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/lightpen.jpg" alt="Light pen" /></p>
    <h3>Digital Camera</h3>
    <p
      >Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically
      using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup
      device. The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to
      the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic
      rather than chemical.</p
    >
    <h3>Web Camera</h3>
    <p
      >A webcam is a video camera which is designed to record or stream to a
      computer or computer network. They are primarily used in video telephony,
      livestreaming and social media, and security. Webcams can be built-in
      computer hardware or peripheral devices, and are commonly connected to a
      device using USB or wireless protocols.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/webcam.jpg" alt="Web cam" /></p>
    <h3>Monitor</h3>
    <p
      >A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in
      pictorial or textual form. A discrete monitor comprises a visual display,
      support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors, and
      external user controls.</p
    >
    <h3>Printer</h3>
    <p
      >In computing, a printer is a peripheral machine which makes a persistent
      representation of graphics or text, usually on paper.</p
    >
    <h3>Projector</h3>
    <p
      >A projector or image projector is an optical device that projects an
      image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen.
      Most projectors create an image by shining a light through a small
      transparent lens, but some newer types of projectors can project the image
      directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal display, or retinal
      projector, is a projector that projects an image directly on the retina
      instead of using an external projection screen.</p
    >
    <h3>Plotter</h3>
    <p
      >A plotter is a machine that produces vector graphics drawings. Plotters
      draw lines on paper using a pen, or in some applications, use a knife to
      cut a material like vinyl or leather. In the latter case, they are
      sometimes known as a cutting plotter.</p
    >
    <p
      >In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided
      design, as they were able to produce line drawings much faster and of a
      higher quality than contemporary conventional printers. Smaller desktop
      plotters were often used for business graphics. Printers with graphics
      capabilities took away some of the market by the early 1980s, and the
      introduction of laser printers in the mid-1980s largely eliminated the use
      of plotters from most roles.</p
    >
    <p
      >Digitally controlled plotters evolved from earlier fully analog
      XY-writers used as output devices for measurement instruments and analog
      computers.</p
    >
    <p
      >Pen plotters print by moving a pen or other instrument across the surface
      of a piece of paper. This means that plotters are vector graphics devices,
      rather than raster graphics as with other printers. Pen plotters can draw
      complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the
      mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently
      creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area by drawing a
      number of close, regular lines.</p
    >
    <p
      >Plotters offered the fastest way to efficiently produce very large
      drawings or color high-resolution vector-based artwork when computer
      memory was very expensive and processor power was very limited, and other
      types of printers had limited graphic output capabilities.</p
    >
    <p
      >Pen plotters have essentially become obsolete, and have been replaced by
      large-format inkjet printers and LED toner-based printers. Such devices
      may still understand vector languages originally designed for plotter use,
      because in many uses, they offer a more efficient alternative to raster
      data.</p
    >
    <h3>CD</h3>
    <p
      >The compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that
      was co-developed by Philips and Sony to store and play digital audio
      recordings.</p
    >
    <p
      >The format was later adapted (as CD-ROM) for general-purpose data
      storage. Several other formats were further derived, including write-once
      audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video CD (VCD),
      Super Video CD (SVCD), Photo CD, Picture CD, Compact Disc-Interactive
      (CD-i) and Enhanced Music CD.</p
    >
    <p
      >Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and are designed
      to hold up to 74 minutes of uncompressed stereo digital audio or about 650
      MiB of data. Capacity is routinely extended to 80 minutes and 700 MiB by
      arranging data more closely on the same sized disc. The Mini CD has
      various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres (2.4 to 3.1 in); they
      are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or
      delivering device drivers.</p
    >
    <p><img src="img/cd.svg" alt="CD" /></p>
    <h3>DVD</h3>
    <p
      >The DVD (common abbreviation for Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile
      Disc)[8][9] is a digital optical disc data storage format. It was invented
      and developed in 1995 and first released on November 1, 1996, in Japan.
      The medium can store any kind of digital data and has been widely used for
      video programs (watched using DVD players) or formerly for storing
      software and other computer files as well. DVDs offer significantly higher
      storage capacity than compact discs (CD) while having the same dimensions.
      A standard DVD can store up to 4.7 GB of storage, while variants can store
      up to a maximum of 17.08 GB.</p
    >
    <h3>Blu Ray Disk</h3>
    <p
      >The Blu-ray Disc (BD), often known simply as Blu-ray, is a digital
      optical disc data storage format. It was invented and developed in 2005
      and released on June 20, 2006 worldwide. It is designed to supersede the
      DVD format, and capable of storing several hours of high-definition video
      (HDTV 720p and 1080p). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for
      video material such as feature films and for the physical distribution of
      video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
      and Xbox Series X. The name &quot;Blu-ray&quot; refers to the blue laser
      (which is actually a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows
      information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the
      longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.</p
    >
    <p
      >The polycarbonate disc is 120 millimetres (4.7 in) in diameter and 1.2
      millimetres (0.047 in) thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional
      or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray Discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual-layer discs
      (50 GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs.
      Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple-layer discs (128 GB) are
      available for BD-XL re-writer drives.</p
    >
    <p
      >High-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray Discs with up to
      1920×1080 pixel resolution, at 24&amp; 50/60 progressive or 50/60
      interlaced frames per second. DVD discs were limited to a maximum
      resolution of 480 (NTSC, 720×480 pixels) or 576 lines (CCIR 625/50,
      720×576 pixels, commonly used with PAL). Besides these hardware
      specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats.</p

    <h3>Pen Drive</h3>
    <p
      >A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash memory
      with an integrated USB interface. It is typically removable, rewritable
      and much smaller than an optical disc.</p
    >
    <p
      >Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile computer memory storage medium
      that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.</p
    >
    <p
      >As of March 2016, flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 gigabytes (GB)
      were frequently sold, while 512 GB and 1 terabyte (TB) units were less
      frequent.</p
    >
    <p
      >As of 2018, 2 TB flash drives were the largest available in terms of
      storage capacity.</p
    >
    <p
      >Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles, depending on the exact type
      of memory chip used, and are thought to physically last between 10 and 100
      years under normal circumstances.</p
