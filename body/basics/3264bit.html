        <h1 id="difference-between-32-bit-and-64-bit-operating-systems">Difference between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems</h1>
<p>A 32-bit system can access 232 different memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory ideally, it can access more than 4 GB of RAM also.</p>
<p>A 64-bit system can access 264 different memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.</p>
<p>A major difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. 64-bit processors can come in dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight-core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster. Software programs that require many calculations to function smoothly can operate faster and more efficiently on the multi-core 64-bit processors, for the most part.</p>
<h2 id="my-take">My take</h2>
<p>Everything is based on the number of calculations a processor can perform. There are physical limits that stop the processor from reaching it maximum potential but for everyday and Scientific Computing applications having a 64 bit processor is more than enough.</p>
<p>Computing is all about solving a problem using logic, where the logic is also part of the computation. The faster a computer can perform these calculations the more we multi-task.</p>
