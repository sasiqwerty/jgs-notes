		<p>
			Earlier, computers were used mostly by scientists and engineers for
			complex calculations and they were very costly too. But, nowadays,
			computers are within the reach of every working person. They have
			virtually become a need in every sphere of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			A computer comprises two major components: hardware and software. The
			physical components of a computer that you can touch and feel are known as
			hardware. Hardware can be further categorised into internal and external
			hardware. A software is a set of programs that instructs a computer about
			the work to be done. Software can be classified into two main categories:
			system software (operating system, utility software, etc.) and application
			software (Word, PowerPoint, Paint, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			Hardware and software are interdependent on each other. Without these two
			components, a computer cannot work. Let us learn about the different
			hardware components of a computer system, in detail.
		</p>
		<h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
		<p>
			The hardware components that are installed inside the CPU cabinet are
			called internal hardware. For example, CPU, RAM, ROM, disk drives,
			Motherboard, Network card, Sound card, Video card, etc.
		</p>
		<h3>Motherboard</h3>
		<p>
			A motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer that holds the most
			essential components of the computer system. The base of a motherboard
			consists of a rigid plastic sheet, known as a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).
			It serves as a single platform to connect all the parts of a computer
			system together and allows them to communicate with each other. A
			motherboard is mounted inside the CPU cabinet and connects CPU, memory,
			hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card, and the other
			expansion cards directly or via cables.<br />
			A motherboard mainly contains:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Processor chip (CPU)</li>
			<li>Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)</li>
			<li>Memory chips (RAM and ROM)</li>
			<li>External storage controllers for video display and sound</li>
			<li>Expansion slots for connecting additional circuit boards</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
		<p>
			The CPU is alternately referred to as a microprocessor. It processes all
			the data and instructions that it receives from hardware and software
			running on a computer and produces results in the form of output. The CPU
			is small in size, fixed on the motherboard. It is usually in the shape of
			a square or rectangle, which consists of millions of very small
			components, including transistors, resistors, and diodes that work
			together to perform a wide variety of functions. The speed of the CPU is
			determined by the number of instructions it executes per second, which is
			measured in gigahertz (GHz).<br />
			There are mainly three components of a CPU:
		</p>
		<h4>Memory Unit (MU):</h4>
		<p>
			It is the principal storage of the computer. It stores both data and
			instructions when entered.
		</p>
		<h4>Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU)</h4>
		<p>This unit performs the arithmetic and logical operations.</p>
		<h4>Control Unit (CU)</h4>
		<p>
			It controls the operation of every other component of a computer system.
			This unit also controls the transfer of data and instructions among the
			other units of computer.
		</p>
		<h3>RAM</h3>
		<p>
			RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It stores the information temporarily
			and can be constantly overwritten with the new data. The information
			stored in the memory is lost when you turn off the computer or the power
			goes off. That is why, it is known as volatile memory. It is directly
			accessed by the CPU, and known as the fastest memory of the computer
			system. The most common RAM size that you can find on computers and
			laptops is 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, so on. RAM is of two types: Static RAM and
			Dynamic RAM.
		</p>
		<h3>ROM</h3>
		<p>
			ROM stands for Read Only Memory. It holds the start up instructions that
			prepare a computer for use. It also consists of programs that check the
			proper working of all the computer parts when you turn it on. The
			instructions stored in ROM cannot be changed, but can only be read. Unlike
			RAM, ROM a is nonvolatile memory. It retains the stored information even
			when the power has been switched off. There are different types of ROM:
			PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.
		</p>
		<h3>Disk Drive</h3>
		<p>
			A disk drive is a hardware component in a computer that enables the users
			to read, write, delete, and modify data on a storage disk. It is either a
			built-in or external component of a disk that manages the input/output
			(I/O) operations of a disk. Disk drives are of several types, such as Hard
			Disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, etc. The most commonly used disk drive is
			the Hard Disk drive.
		</p>
		<h3>Hard Disk</h3>
		<p>
			A hard disk is a magnetic storage device used to store and retrieve
			data.<br />
			Nowadays, hard disk come in various capacities, 512 GB, 1 TB, 5 TB, and so
			on. A hard disk is generally embedded within the disk itself or housed in
			a separate box external to the computer. It is made up of a collection of
			disks known as platters, stacked on top of each other. Each platter
			consists of two read/write heads on both the sides for reading the stored
			data. All the read/write heads are attached to a single access arm so that
			they do not move independently. Each platter has the same number of tracks
			to store data. A track location that cuts across all platters is called a
			cylinder.
		</p>
		<h3>SMPS</h3>
		<p>
			SMPS stands for Switching-Mode Power Supply. It is essential for safe
			running of power consuming electrical and electronic components of the
			CPU. SMPS uses a switching regulator to control and stabilise the output
			voltage by switching the load current on or off. It transfers electric
			power from a source (AC mains) to low voltage Direct Current (DC). It
			always supplies a well-regulated power to the motherboard and the other
			parts of a computer and saves power. It has a built-in fan to release the
			excessive heat during the time computer is in use.
		</p>
		<h3>Modem</h3>
		<p>
			Modem stands for modulator-demodulator. It is a device that allows a
			computer to send or receive information through telephone lines by
			converting digital data into analog signals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Modulator converts digital information of a computer to analog mode at the
			transmitting end and demodulator further converts back the analog signals
			to digital at the receiving end. Modems can be classified as: Internal
			Modem and External Modem.
		</p>
		<h4>Internal Modem</h4>
		<p>
			An internal modem comes pre-installed in the computer. PC card modems are
			specifically designed for portable computers. They are roughly the size of
			a credit card. The speed of a modem is measured in bps, i.e., bits per
			second.
		</p>
		<h4>External Modem</h4>
		<p>
			It is a modem that is installed outside the CPU. It is a box-like
			structure that is normally connected to USB port of a computer. This type
			of modem has indicator lights that display the speed of a modem, measured
			in bps, i.e., bits per second. If the telephone line quality is not good,
			it will not be able to work with its maximum speed.
		</p>
		<h5>Let's Know More</h5>
		<p>
			mechanical hard disks with flash-based A Solid-State drive (SSD) is a new
			generation of storage device used in computers or laptops. SSDs replace
			traditional memory, which is much faster. It speeds up computers
			significantly due to their short read access times and high performance.
		</p>
		<h5>Let's Know More</h5>
		<p>
			A sound card is a hardware component that is fixed either in an expansion
			slot or built into the motherboard. It handles the input and output of the
			sound signals.
		</p>
		<p>
			A video card is also known as a graphics card. It is used to enhance the
			quality of the displayed images. Graphics cards come in four basic types:
			Integrated, PCI, AGP, and PCI-E cards.
		</p>
		<h5>Note</h5>
		<p>
			PC Card Modem is specifically designed for laptops and handheld computers.
			It is similar to the size of a credit card and fits into the PC Card slot
			on notebook and handheld computers.
		</p>
		<h3>Heat Sink</h3>
		<p>
			A heat sink is an electronic device, which is designed to disperse the
			heat generated by the CPU. It is made up of metal, such as a copper or
			aluminum alloy, and normally uses a fan to keep the processor cool.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heat sink is commonly used in all CPUs. It is also used in refrigeration
			and air<br />
			conditioning systems, Graphic Processing Systems (GPUs), and so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Ports</h3>
		<p>
			A computer port is a slot on the motherboard that acts as a point of
			connection between a computer and an external device. Cables of external
			devices, like keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor etc., are plugged into
			these ports to attach them to a computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are several types of ports that are used to connect the various
			external devices to the computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the ports are visible at the backside of the CPU cabinet while a
			few are placed in front. The placement of these ports may vary from
			computer to computer. Some of these ports are colour-coded to identify a
			specific device to be plugged in them.
		</p>
		<h4>Serial Port</h4>
		<p>
			It transfers the information in or out sequentially one bit at a time. It
			requires only one data line for data transmission. It is used to connect
			various peripherals, such as external modems, mouse, printers, PDAs,
			digital cameras, which are of the old model.
		</p>
		<h4>Parallel Port</h4>
		<p>
			It transfers several bits of data together at one time. It is used to
			connect scanners, printers, CD writer, external hard disk drive, etc.
		</p>
		<h4>USB</h4>
		<p>
			USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. Nowadays, keyboard, mouse, printers,
			scanners, flash drives, digital and web cameras, etc., come with USB cable
			connectors that are connected with the USB ports.
		</p>
		<h4>PS/2 Port</h4>
		<p>
			PS/2 connector was developed by IBM in 1987. PS/2 port is now considered a
			legacy port as it has been replaced by the USB port. It was used for
			attaching keyboard and mouse to a computer.<br />
			It is also known as IEEE 1394, and developed by Apple Inc. It can transfer
			a large amount of data with speed upto 800 Mbps and connect upto 63
			different devices.
		</p>
		<h4>FireWire</h4>
		<p>
			You can use FireWire port to connect external devices, such as a hard
			drive or digital video camera, without restarting your computer.
		</p>
		<h4>VGA</h4>
		<p>
			VGA stands for Video Graphics Array. This port is similar to a serial port
			connector. The only difference is that the serial port has pins, whereas
			VGA connector has holes. With the increase in the use of digital video,
			VGA ports are gradually being replaced by HDMI and display ports. It is
			used to connect monitors or projectors to a computer.
		</p>
		<h4>HDMI</h4>
		<p>
			HDMI stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface. It is a digital
			connector that can carry high definition video and audio. It can also send
			audio to different formats. It is used to connect high definition and
			ultra high definition devices, like computer monitors, HD TVs, gaming
			consoles, high definition cameras, etc., to a computer.
		</p>
		<h4>Ethernet Port</h4>
		<p>
			An ethernet RJ 45 connector looks like a telephone line RJ 11 connector.
			It is used to connect your computer with a wired network.<br />
			Line-in: It enables a user to connect an external audio device with the
			computer.
		</p>
		<h4>Audio</h4>
		<p>
			Line-out: It allows external speakers, headphones, or other output devices
			to be connected to the computer.<br />
			Mic port: It helps in plugging microphone into the computer.
		</p>
		<h2>External Hardware</h2>
		<p>
			The components that are attached to the computer externally, are called
			external hardware components. These are also known as Peripherals. These
			peripherals can be divided into three categories: Input devices, Output
			devices, and Storage devices.
		</p>
		<h3>Input Devices</h3>
		<p>
			Input devices are used to enter data and information into a computer.
			These devices convert the incoming data and instructions into a pattern of
			binary codes (understood by a computer) and then supply the converted data
			to the processor for processing.
		</p>
		<h4>Keyboard</h4>
		<p>
			Keyboard is one of the most important input devices used to input data and
			instructions into a computer. The commonly used keyboard has 104 keys,
			which can be divided into many groups based on their functions, such as
			Alphanumeric keys, Combination keys, Function keys, Navigation keys, and
			so on.
		</p>
		<h4>Mouse</h4>
		<p>
			Mouse is the most commonly used input and pointing device that lets you
			select and move items on the screen. The left mouse button is used more
			frequently than the right button. A single-click selects an item while
			double-clicking opens the application. The right-click often displays a
			list of commands on the screen.<br />
			You can also use a mouse to drag and drop an item on the screen, draw
			free-hand lines, circles, boxes, so on. Let us know about two different
			types of mouse.
		</p>
		<h5>Mechanical Mouse</h5>
		<p>
			This type of mouse has a metal or rubber ball on its lower side that can
			roll in all the directions. The screen pointer moves according to the
			movement of the ball, which is detected by the mechanical sensors within
			the mouse.
		</p>
		<h5>Optical Mouse</h5>
		<p>
			Optical mouse does not have any mechanical moving parts. It uses a light
			source, typically a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) and a light detector to
			detect the movement of the mouse. An optical mouse is more efficient than
			the mechanical mouse.
		</p>
		<h4>Scanner</h4>
		<p>
			It is an input device that scans text, images, and objects optically. The
			scanned data is then converted into a digital image and displayed on the
			computer screen.<br />
			Following are the different types of scanners:
		</p>
		<h5>Drum Scanner</h5>
		<p>
			This is a high-end and expensive scanner used by professionals. It uses
			Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) technology to scan images. In a drum scanner,
			the image or document to be scanned is mounted on a glass cylinder. At the
			centre of the cylinder, a sensor that separates the bounced light from the
			paper into three beams, optically Red, Green, and Blue, accurately
			rendering the image. The drum scanners are used mainly in the publishing
			industry to print high quality images in books and magazines.
		</p>
		<h5>Flatbed Scanner</h5>
		<p>
			This is a popular optical scanner. It has a flip-up cover protecting the
			glass window. In a flatbed scanner, the object to be scanned is placed
			face down on the glass window, which is then illuminated with a bright
			light. It uses the Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to read the
			entire area optically. Depending on its size, a flatbed scanner can fit
			standard or legal-sized documents and its flexible cover allows you to
			scan books, newspapers, articles, photographs, etc. The flatbed scanners
			are used in homes, schools, and medium-sized offices.
		</p>
		<h5>Sheetfed Scanner</h5>
		<p>
			It is also known as an automatic document scanner. It closely resembles a
			compact laser or inkjet printer and has a similar paper handling
			mechanism. It scans loose papers quickly and easily and helps to boost
			productivity at the workplace. It is a fast, reliable, versatile, and
			business-oriented scanner, mainly used in large organisations.
		</p>
		<h5>Handheld Scanner</h5>
		<p>
			This is a small manual device, which is dragged over the surface of the
			image to be scanned. These scanners are operated by hand. It is difficult
			to operate these scanners as they need a steady hand to scan objects in
			order to avoid distorted images. Bar code scanner is one of the most
			utilised handheld scanner used in shopping malls.
		</p>
		<h4>Microphone</h4>
		<p>
			It is an input device, used to record and store voice or any other sound
			into a computer, generally as a .wav file. It is also used for recording a
			narration in a PowerPoint presentation. It is used as a separate component
			for desktops but can be seen as an integrated component in some laptops.
			You can notice a special port in these computers where a microphone can be
			connected. A microphone is commonly used in video conferencing, speech
			recognition programs, radio broadcasting, recording, and sound amplifying
			systems.
		</p>
		<h4>Light Pen</h4>
		<p>
			It is a light-sensitive pointing device, commonly used to select or modify
			data on the screen. It allows the user to point on displayed objects or
			draw on the screen. Its operation is similar to a touch screen but has a
			greater positional accuracy. It is easy to use and helpful for programs,
			like Computer Aided Design (CAD).
		</p>
		<h4>Digital Camera</h4>
		<p>
			A digital camera is quite similar to a traditional camera that is used to
			capture both videos and photographs. These videos and images can be
			transferred to a computer through a data cable or by using a card reader
			for storing, editing, and printing, etc. Nowadays, mobile phones also have
			inbuilt digital cameras.
		</p>
		<h4>Web Camera</h4>
		<p>
			A web camera is a device connected to a computer for capturing still
			images and live videos. It is primarily used for video conferencing and
			live chatting with your friends and relatives using the internet.
		</p>
		<h3>Output Devicees</h3>
		<p>
			Output devices are used to display or print the processed data in a user
			readable form. A computer can have several output devices attached to it.
			Some of the common output devices are monitor, projector, printer, and
			plotter. Storage devices store information for the future reference of the
			user. The commonly used storage<br />
			devices are hard disk, pen drive, CD, and DVD. Let us know about these
			hardware components of a computer, in detail.
		</p>
		<h4>Monitor</h4>
		<p>
			Monitor is the most common output device. It is also called Visual Display
			Unit (VDU). Just like a television, a monitor also displays the output on
			the screen. The picture on a monitor is made up of thousands of small
			coloured dots called pixels. The output displayed on the monitor is called
			soft copy. Some commonly used types of monitors are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Monitors</li>
			<li>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)</li>
			<li>Thin Film Transistor (TFT) monitors</li>
			<li>Light Emitting Diode (LED) monitors</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Printer</h4>
		<p>
			A printer is a peripheral device that prints the information on a paper. A
			printed paper is called a hard copy. Modern printers are connected to a
			computer using a USB port or Wi-Fi connection. Printers vary in size,
			speed, b and cost. Printers can be categorised into the following:
		</p>
		<h5>Impact Printers</h5>
		<p>
			Impact printers allow physical contact between the printer head and paper,
			i.e., these printers print by the impact of printer head on the paper.
			They are also called character printers. Example: Daisy Wheel Printers,
			Dot-Matrix Printers, etc.
		</p>
		<h5>Non-Impact Printers</h5>
		<p>
			Non-Impact printers do not allow physical contact between the printing
			head and paper, i.e., they do not strike against the inked ribbon or the
			paper that is being printed. Only the ink used for printing, touches the
			paper. Non-impact printers have better print quality. Example: Thermal
			Printers, Ink Jet Printers, Laser Printers, etc.
		</p>
		<h4>Projector</h4>
		<p>
			A projector is an output device that takes the images generated by a
			computer and displays them onto a big screen, wall, or any other flat
			surface. A projector is commonly used in a school classroom for teaching,
			to project the presentation about some newly launched product or strategy,
			theaters for projecting films, and so on.
		</p>
		<h4>Plotter</h4>
		<p>
			A plotter is another example of the output device. It prints your work on
			paper, which is very large in size. It prints the output by moving
			coloured pens across the surface of a piece of paper. It is generally used
			for flex printing, such as banners, posters, maps, and so on. It can draw
			complex line art, including text, but does so very slowly because of the
			mechanical movement of the pens.
		</p>
		<h4>CD</h4>
		<p>
			CD stands for Compact Disc. It is an optical storage device. A CD is a
			thin, shiny, circular disc that can store up to 700 MB of data and
			measures 4.7 inches in diameter. A CD can hold text, graphics, sound,
			images, and videos. It can be used for data backup and storing software.
			To access data from a CD, you need to place it in the CD drive, which is
			located in the front panel of the CPU cabinet. There are two types of
			CD-ROMs:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R)</li>
			<li>Compact Disc Re-Writable (CD-RW)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>DVD</h4>
		<p>
			DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc also known as Digital Video Disc. It
			is an optical storage device, used for data storage and recording movies
			with high video and sound quality. Though, a DVD is similar to a CD in
			shape and size, but a DVD can store data six times more than a CD. Its
			storage capacity varies from 4.7 GB to 17 GB. Like a CD, a DVD is also
			available in many versions, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>DVD-R</li>
			<li>DVD-RW</li>
			<li>DVD+R</li>
			<li>DVD+RW</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Blu-Ray Disc</h4>
		<p>
			Blu-ray disc is a new optical disc format that is rapidly replacing a DVD.
			The name Blu-ray has been derived from the blue-violet laser, which is
			used to read and write data. This disc has the same dimension as a DVD and
			CD but can hold upto 25 GB of data on a single layer and 50 GB of data on
			a dual layer disc. It is mainly used for storing high quality audio,
			video, and games.
		</p>
		<h4>Pen Drive</h4>
		<p>
			It is a small and portable flash memory data storage device, mainly used
			to transfer audio, video, and data files from the hard disk of one
			computer to another. It is a plug and play device and can be connected
			with the Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. It consists of a small Printed
			Circuit Board (PCB), which has the circuit elements and a USB connector
			that is electrically insulated and protected inside a plastic, metal, or
			rubberised case.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pen drive is also called Flash drive or Thumb drive and available with the
			storage capacity of up to 1 TB of data.
