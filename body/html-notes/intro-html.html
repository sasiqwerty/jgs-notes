    <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h3>Hypertext</h3>
    <p>
      A system allowing extensive cross-referencing between related sections of
      text and associated graphics.
    </p>
    <h3>Markup Language</h3>
    <p>
      Mark up is plain text with special symbols, the special symbols tell the
      browser/user to display/understand the document and its structure.
    </p>
    <h2>Why HTML is important</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTML gives structure to the web document, by converting plain text into
        something more meaningful using tags.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS adds style to the web document, its has nothing to do with the
        structure of the document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attributes of the elements have many uses, they can act as hooks to
        apply CSS,JS and many more functions
      </li>
      <li>
        Cross-referencing the text using hyperlinks makes the internet more
        connected. Any part of the web can be connected using the hyperlinks
        making HTML that much more effective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using JavaScript we make the web-document dynamic and interactive.
      </li>
    </ul>
