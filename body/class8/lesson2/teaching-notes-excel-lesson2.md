## Formula

A formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically. It is a set of symbols that represent a rule, principle, or relationship. Formulas are used in mathematics, science, engineering, and other fields.

In mathematics, formulas are used to express relationships between numbers and variables. For example, the formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2bh, where A is the area, b is the base, and h is the height.

In chemistry, formulas are used to represent the composition of chemical compounds.

A formula in Microsoft Excel is a set of instructions that tells Excel to perform a calculation on the data in a worksheet. Formulas always start with an equal sign (=), and they can contain numbers, cell references, functions, and operators.
