				<h2>Functions of the operating system with an example</h2>
				<p>
					Imagine a bustling city with thousands of buildings, cars, people, and
					activities happening all at once. It would be chaos if there were no
					traffic rules, public services, and authorities to manage and
					coordinate everything. The operating system (OS) is like the city's
					management system, providing a structured and efficient way for
					different programs, hardware, and users to interact and operate on a
					computer. Here are some examples of the functions of an OS:
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Resource management:</strong> The OS allocates and manages the
					computer's resources such as memory, processor, storage, and
					input/output devices. It ensures that each program gets a fair share
					of the resources and prevents conflicts or crashes. It's like a
					traffic controller regulating the flow of vehicles on different roads
					to avoid congestion and accidents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>User interface:</strong> The OS provides a graphical or
					command-line interface that enables users to interact with the
					computer and its programs. It's like a concierge who welcomes guests
					to a hotel and shows them around, providing menus, maps, and
					directions.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>File management</strong>: The OS organizes, stores, and
					retrieves files and folders on the computer's storage devices. It
					ensures that users can access their data easily and securely, and
					prevents data loss or corruption. It's like a librarian who catalogs
					books and arranges them in shelves, ensuring that each book has a
					unique identifier and location.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Security</strong>: The OS protects the computer and its data
					from unauthorized access, viruses, and malware. It enforces user
					authentication, encryption, firewalls, and other security measures to
					prevent data breaches or system damage. It's like a police force that
					patrols the city, checks IDs, and investigates suspicious activities.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Networking</strong>: The OS enables the computer to connect
					and communicate with other computers and devices on a network. It
					provides protocols, drivers, and services for data transfer, sharing,
					and remote access. It's like a telecommunication company that sets up
					phone lines, routers, and satellites to connect people across the
					world.
				</p>

				<p>
					Overall, the OS is the backbone of the computer, providing a stable,
					secure, and user-friendly environment for a wide range of applications
					and users. Without an OS, a computer would be just a collection of
					parts, unable to perform any meaningful task.

				<h2>Resources available for the operating system</h2>
				<p>
					There are several resources available for the operating system to
					manage and allocate efficiently, including:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Memory</strong>: This is the computer's primary storage
						space for data and program instructions. The operating system
						manages the memory to ensure that each program gets the memory it
						needs to run correctly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Processor</strong>: This is the computer's central
						processing unit (CPU), which performs calculations and executes
						program instructions. The operating system manages the processor to
						ensure that each program gets a fair share of processing time and
						that the system does not become overloaded.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Storage</strong>: This includes the hard drive, solid-state
						drive, and other storage devices that hold the computer's data and
						programs. The operating system manages storage to ensure that files
						are stored efficiently and that data is not lost or corrupted.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Input/output devices</strong>: These include the keyboard,
						mouse, monitor, printer, and other devices that allow users to
						interact with the computer. The operating system manages
						input/output devices to ensure that they work correctly and that
						data is transferred between the devices and the computer smoothly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Network resources</strong>: These include the network
						interface card (NIC), router, and other devices that enable the
						computer to communicate with other computers and devices over a
						network. The operating system manages network resources to ensure
						that data is transmitted correctly and that the network is secure.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Overall, the operating system manages and allocates these resources to
					ensure that programs run correctly and that the computer operates
					efficiently.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Process Management</h2>
				<p>
					In computing, a process is an instance of a program that is currently
					running on a computer's operating system. A process is a fundamental
					concept in operating system design and is the unit of work in a
					computer system.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a program is executed, the operating system creates a process to
					manage its execution. The process consists of the program code and
					data, as well as the resources that the program needs to run, such as
					memory, processor time, and input/output devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each process has its own address space, which is the memory area where
					the program's instructions and data are stored. The operating system
					manages the memory allocation and deallocation for each process,
					ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Processes also have their own execution context, including the values
					of the processor's registers and the program counter, which indicates
					the current instruction being executed. The operating system manages
					the scheduling of processes, determining which process gets access to
					the CPU and for how long.
				</p>
				<p>
					Processes can communicate with each other and with the operating
					system through various mechanisms, such as inter-process communication
					(IPC), signals, and system calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, a process is a fundamental unit of work in an operating
					system, representing the execution of a program and the allocation of
					resources necessary for its operation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Memory Management</h2>
				<p>
					The operating system manages memory by allocating and deallocating
					memory resources for processes and ensuring that they do not interfere
					with each other. Here are some of the ways the operating system
					manages memory:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Memory allocation: When a process requests memory, the operating
						system allocates a portion of memory for the process. The operating
						system keeps track of which memory locations are available and which
						are in use, ensuring that each process gets the memory it needs. The
						operating system can also use techniques such as virtual memory to
						allocate memory that is not physically present in the computer's
						main memory.
					</li>
					<li>
						Memory protection: The operating system uses memory protection to
						prevent one process from accessing or modifying the memory used by
						another process. The operating system sets up memory protection by
						assigning each process its own address space, ensuring that the
						memory used by one process is not used by another process.
					</li>
					<li>
						Memory deallocation: When a process is finished executing or no
						longer needs memory, the operating system deallocates the memory
						used by the process. The operating system marks the memory as free,
						making it available for use by other processes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Memory swapping: When the computer's physical memory is low, the
						operating system can swap out parts of a process's memory to disk to
						free up physical memory. The operating system can then swap the
						memory back into physical memory when it is needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Memory fragmentation: Over time, memory can become fragmented,
						meaning that free memory is scattered throughout memory space in
						small pieces. The operating system can use memory compaction
						techniques to defragment memory, rearranging memory allocations to
						reduce fragmentation.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Overall, the operating system manages memory to ensure that each
					process gets the memory it needs and that processes do not interfere
					with each other. This helps to ensure the stability and performance of
					the computer system.
				</p>

				<h2>Provision of User Interface</h2>
				<p>
					The building blocks of a user interface are the fundamental elements
					that make up the interface and allow users to interact with a computer
					system. Here are some of the most common building blocks of a user
					interface:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Windows: A window is a rectangular area on the computer screen that
						displays information or allows the user to interact with the system.
						Windows can be moved, resized, minimized, and closed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Icons: Icons are small graphical representations of files, folders,
						programs, or other objects that are displayed on the screen. Icons
						provide a quick and easy way for users to access frequently used
						items.
					</li>
					<li>
						Menus: Menus are lists of options that are displayed when a user
						clicks on a menu bar or right-clicks on an object. Menus allow users
						to perform tasks or access information in an organized and
						hierarchical manner.
					</li>
					<li>
						Buttons: Buttons are graphical elements that the user can click on
						to perform an action. Buttons can be used for tasks such as
						submitting a form, starting a program, or closing a window.
					</li>
					<li>
						Text fields: Text fields allow users to input text or numbers into a
						program or form. Text fields can be used for tasks such as entering
						a search term or filling out a contact form.
					</li>
					<li>
						Dialog boxes: Dialog boxes are windows that are displayed to the
						user to provide additional information or to request input. Dialog
						boxes can be used for tasks such as confirming an action or changing
						program settings.
					</li>
					<li>
						Toolbars: Toolbars are graphical elements that provide quick access
						to frequently used commands or tools. Toolbars can be customized to
						include only the most commonly used tools.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Overall, these building blocks of a user interface provide the
					foundation for users to interact with computer systems in a way that
					is intuitive and efficient. By using these elements in a well-designed
					interface, software developers can create interfaces that are easy to
					use and increase user productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A story Example</strong> <br />
					A man named John gets lost in a new city during a business trip. He
					couldn't understand directions given by a passerby due to a language
					barrier, but luckily he remembered he had a map in his bag. After
					matching the street names, he was able to find his way back to the
					hotel. John learned the importance of carrying a map while traveling
					in unfamiliar places.
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					Jhon was asking for help in an unfamiliar area, this can be thought as
					an users attempt to navigate the interface without guidance or
					assistance.,
				</p>

				<p>
					In the context of user interface, a map could be a graphical
					representation of a software application's navigation system. It can
					help users understand how to move through the various pages or screens
					of the application and locate specific functions or features. Just
					like a real-world map, a user interface map provides an overview of
					the application's structure, making it easier for users to navigate
					and find what they need. This can be especially important for complex
					applications or those with multiple layers of functionality.
				</p>

					File management is an important function of an operating system that
					involves organizing, storing, and accessing files on a computer
					system. Here are some of the key aspects of file management in an
					operating system:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						File system: The file system is a hierarchical structure used by the
						operating system to organize files and directories. The file system
						provides a way for the operating system to locate and access files
						on the computer system.
					</li>

					<li>
						File naming: Each file on the computer system is assigned a unique
						name. The file name is used by the operating system to identify and
						locate the file. The file name can also provide information about
						the contents of the file.
					</li>

					<li>
						File attributes: File attributes are properties that describe a
						file, such as the file size, date created, date modified, and file
						type. These attributes are used by the operating system to manage
						and access files.
					</li>

					<li>
						File operations: The operating system provides a range of file
						operations, including creating, copying, moving, deleting, and
						renaming files. These operations are used to manage and organize
						files on the computer system.
					</li>

					<li>
						File access control: The operating system provides mechanisms to
						control access to files. This includes setting permissions for users
						and groups to determine who can access and modify files.
					</li>

					<li>
						File backup and recovery: The operating system provides mechanisms
						to back up files to protect against data loss. This includes the
						ability to create backups of files and restore them in case of a
						system failure or data corruption.

			<div>
				<h2>Job Scheduling</h2>
				<p>
					Job scheduling is the process of determining which processes or tasks
					should be executed by the operating system and in what order. In a
					computer system, there are typically multiple processes or tasks
					competing for system resources, such as CPU time and memory, and job
					scheduling helps to ensure that these resources are allocated
					efficiently and fairly among the processes.
				</p>

				<p>
					The job scheduler is responsible for determining the order in which
					processes should be executed based on a set of scheduling algorithms.
					These algorithms consider factors such as the priority of the process,
					the amount of CPU time required by the process, and the amount of
					memory required by the process.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<h6>
						Some common scheduling algorithms used in job scheduling include:
					</h6>

					<li>
						First-come, first-served (FCFS): This algorithm executes processes
						in the order in which they are received by the system. Processes are
						executed in a queue, with the first process in the queue being
						executed first.
					</li>

					<li>
						Shortest job first (SJF): This algorithm prioritizes processes based
						on their estimated execution time. The process with the shortest
						estimated execution time is executed first.
					</li>

					<li>
						Priority scheduling: This algorithm assigns a priority level to each
						process based on its importance. The process with the highest
						priority level is executed first.
					</li>

					<li>
						Round-robin scheduling: This algorithm allocates CPU time to each
						process in equal time slices. Each process is executed for a set
						amount of time before being preempted and moved to the back of the
						queue.
					</li>

					<li>
						Job scheduling plays an important role in ensuring that computer
						systems are used efficiently and effectively. By prioritizing and
						organizing processes, job scheduling helps to maximize system
						resources, minimize response time, and ensure that critical
						processes are executed in a timely manner.
					</li>
				</ul>

					which are designed to protect computer systems and their users from
					various security threats and unauthorized access. Here are some of the
					ways in which an operating system provides security and protection:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Access control: The operating system provides mechanisms to control
						access to system resources such as files, folders, and devices.
						Access control allows the operating system to ensure that only
						authorized users or processes can access these resources.
					</li>

					<li>
						User authentication: The operating system provides authentication
						mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, or smart cards to verify
						the identity of users before allowing them to access the system.
					</li>

					<li>
						Encryption: The operating system provides encryption mechanisms to
						protect sensitive data stored on the computer system. Encryption
						converts plain text into a coded form that is unreadable without the
						correct decryption key.
					</li>
