			<h1>Types of RAM</h1>

			<ul>
				<li>RAM stands for Random Access Memory.</li>
				<li>
					There are two main types of RAM: Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM
					(DRAM).
				</li>
				<li>
					SRAM relies on static flip-flops to store data, while DRAM uses
					capacitors to store information.
				</li>
				<li>
					DRAM is the most common type of RAM used in computers today. DRAM is
					further divided into SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5.
				</li>
				<li>
					SDRAM stands for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory and is
					faster than DRAM. DDR stands for Double Data Rate and is faster than
					SDRAM.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>SRAM</h3>
			<p>
				SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory. It is a type of RAM that
				relies on static flip-flops to store data. This means that the
				information stored in SRAM can be retained for a long time without power
				failure and no additional circuit refresh is required. SRAM requires
				about six transistors for a memory cell, which makes it high-cost,
				small-capacity, and high-speed. Therefore, it is often used as the
				primary cache or secondary cache of the CPU.
			</p>
			<h3>DRAM</h3>
			<p>
				DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is a type of RAM that
				uses capacitors to store information. However, any capacitor has leakage
				(charge loss), so the stored information will be lost. To solve this
				problem, DRAM needs to read and rewrite (so-called refresh) the DRAM at
				regular intervals (2ms). DRAM requires about one transistor and one
				capacitor for a memory cell, which makes it low-cost and large-capacity,
				but it needs to be refreshed and the speed is slower than SRAM.
				Therefore, it is often used as the main memory of the computer.
			</p>
			<h3>SDRAM</h3>
			<p>
				SDRAM stands for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is a type
				of DRAM that is synchronized with the clock speed of the system bus.
				This means that SDRAM can operate at higher speeds than conventional
				DRAM. SDRAM is faster than DRAM and is commonly used in computers.
